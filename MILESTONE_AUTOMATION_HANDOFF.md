# Milestone Progression Automation UI - Handoff Document

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user requested implementation of visual-only "Add automation" buttons between milestones in release plans, with specific design requirements:
- Use Material-UI IconButton with outlined style
- Primary color for the plus icon and outline border
- Background matching the release plan's gray area
- Bold "Add automation" text label positioned next to the button
- Feature controlled by `milestoneProgression` feature flag
- Maintain original milestone spacing when flag is disabled
- No hover state on the button
- Different connector line styling based on feature flag state

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- Material-UI (MUI) components: `IconButton`, `Button`, `styled`
- React hooks: `useUiFlag` for feature flag management
- TypeScript with React component composition
- MUI theme system with `theme.spacing()` and `theme.palette`
- Conditional rendering with `ConditionallyRender` component
- Feature flag management in Unleash
- CSS absolute positioning and layout
- Theme color system: `elevation2` for gray backgrounds, `primary` color scheme
- Git workflow: branch creation, commits, and PR creation with GitHub CLI

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `frontend/src/component/feature/FeatureView/FeatureOverview/ReleasePlan/ReleasePlan.tsx`

**Why important**: Main component containing the release plan milestone progression UI. This is where all the "Add automation" button UI was implemented.

**Changes made**:

1. Added imports:
```typescript
import Add from '@mui/icons-material/Add';
import { styled, IconButton, Button } from '@mui/material';
import { useUiFlag } from 'hooks/useUiFlag';
```

2. Created styled components for automation UI:
```typescript
const StyledConnection = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({
    width: 2,
    height: theme.spacing(6),
    backgroundColor: theme.palette.divider,
    marginLeft: theme.spacing(3.25),
}));

const StyledConnectionSimple = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({
    width: 4,
    height: theme.spacing(2),
    backgroundColor: theme.palette.divider,
    marginLeft: theme.spacing(3.25),
}));

const StyledConnectionContainer = styled('div')(({ theme }) => ({
    position: 'relative',
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
}));

const StyledAddAutomationIconButton = styled(IconButton)(({ theme }) => ({
    position: 'absolute',
    left: theme.spacing(1.8),
    top: '12px',
    width: 24,
    height: 24,
    border: `1px solid ${theme.palette.primary.main}`,
    backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.elevation2,
    zIndex: 1,
    '& svg': {
        fontSize: 16,
    },
}));

const StyledAddAutomationButton = styled(Button)(({ theme }) => ({
    marginLeft: theme.spacing(3),
    textTransform: 'none',
    fontWeight: theme.typography.fontWeightBold,
    padding: 0,
    minWidth: 'auto',
    '&:hover': {
        backgroundColor: 'transparent',
    },
}));
```

3. Added feature flag:
```typescript
const milestoneProgressionsEnabled = useUiFlag('milestoneProgression');
```

4. Updated JSX to render automation buttons between milestones:
```typescript
<ConditionallyRender
    condition={index < milestones.length - 1}
    show={
        <ConditionallyRender
            condition={milestoneProgressionsEnabled}
            show={
                <StyledConnectionContainer>
                    <StyledConnection />
                    <StyledAddAutomationIconButton color='primary'>
                        <Add />
                    </StyledAddAutomationIconButton>
                    <StyledAddAutomationButton color='primary'>
                        Add automation
                    </StyledAddAutomationButton>
                </StyledConnectionContainer>
            }
            elseShow={<StyledConnectionSimple />}
        />
    }
/>
```

### `frontend/src/interfaces/uiConfig.ts`

**Why important**: Read to verify the correct feature flag name exists in the UiFlags type definition.

**Relevant code**:
```typescript
export type UiFlags = {
    // ... other flags
    milestoneProgression?: boolean;
    // ... other flags
};
```

### `.playwright-mcp/milestone-automation-ui.png`

**Why important**: Screenshot taken to include in the PR, showing the visual implementation of the "Add automation" buttons.

## 4. Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: Button too large
- **Issue**: Initial IconButton implementation with default size was too large
- **Fix**: Set explicit dimensions: `width: 24px, height: 24px` and icon fontSize: 16px
- **User feedback**: "It's too large now"

### Error 2: Connector line visible through button
- **Issue**: Background was transparent/white, showing the gray connector line behind the button
- **Fix**: Changed `backgroundColor` from `theme.palette.background.paper` to `theme.palette.background.elevation2` to match the release plan's gray background
- **User feedback**: "The offline button should actually have a background so you don't see the connector behind the button."

### Error 3: Incorrect feature flag name
- **Issue**: Used `milestoneProgressions` (plural) initially
- **Fix**: Corrected to `milestoneProgression` (singular) after checking uiConfig.ts
- **TypeScript error**: "Argument of type '\"milestoneProgressions\"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'keyof UiFlags'"

### Error 4: Milestone spacing changed when flag disabled
- **Issue**: Removing the connector entirely when flag was off changed the spacing between milestones
- **Fix**: Added `elseShow={<StyledConnectionSimple />}` to maintain original spacing with the simple connector
- **User feedback**: "The spacing of milestones look weird now. We need to maintain the same space as before when the flag is off."

### Error 5: Wrong connector dimensions based on flag state
- **Issue**: Needed different connector line dimensions for flag on/off states
- **Fix**: Created two separate styled components:
  - `StyledConnection`: 2px width, theme.spacing(6) height (flag ON)
  - `StyledConnectionSimple`: 4px width, theme.spacing(2) height (flag OFF)
- **User feedback**: "So, if the feature flag is on the styledconnection height should be 6, otherwise 2."

## 5. Problem Solving

Successfully implemented a feature-flagged UI addition to the release plan milestones:
1. Iterated on button design through multiple refinements based on user feedback
2. Ensured proper visual hierarchy with primary colors and appropriate sizing
3. Solved the background transparency issue to hide connector lines
4. Maintained backward compatibility with original spacing when feature is disabled
5. Created proper feature flag integration for gradual rollout
6. Documented changes with screenshot in GitHub PR

## 6. All User Messages

1. "So the button should be an outlined icon button that has the primary color as the plus icon and the outline in the button."
2. "It's too large now"
3. "Make the add automation also be a button so that the text is bolded and move it slightly closer to the plus icon."
4. "The offline button should actually have a background so you don't see the connector behind the button."
5. "We didn't hear it, it looks like we still see the divider underneath the button. We shouldn't see the divider."
6. "Can't you make the background be the gray color so that it is overlaying the divider and just showing that color instead?"
7. "Sorry, I meant the outline should be the primary color, but the background should be the same as the rest of the gray area."
8. "Disabler the hover state, we can keep it as is. And add the milestoneProgression feature flag."
9. "The flag needs to encompass everything we added, also the divider."
10. "We need to keep the old StyledConnection"
11. "So, if the feature flag is on the styledconnection height should be 6, otherwise 2."
12. "Create a PR with a short description of this feature."
13. "Can we add a screenshot?"
14. "Create a summary of the work we have done so far and relevant context. Think of it as a handoff document to pick up later."

## 7. Pending Tasks

None - all requested work has been completed and PR has been created.

## 8. Current Work

Just completed creating GitHub PR #10743 titled "feat: add milestone progression automation UI" with:
- Detailed description of the feature
- Screenshot showing the implementation (`.playwright-mcp/milestone-automation-ui.png`)
- Explanation of visual design choices
- Note about feature flag for gradual rollout

The PR URL: https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/pull/10743

All implementation work is complete and pushed to branch `feat/milestone-progression-automation-ui`.

## 9. Optional Next Steps

No immediate next steps - the task is complete. The PR is ready for review. If continuing work on this feature, potential next steps would be:
- Implementing click functionality for the "Add automation" buttons (currently visual-only)
- Creating the automation configuration dialog/modal
- Implementing backend API integration for milestone progression automation

However, these should only be pursued after explicit user direction, as the original scope stated: "It's OK if they don't do anything" for the buttons.

## Visual Reference
