## About Unleash

Unleash is an open source feature management solution. It improves the workflow of your development team and leads to quicker software delivery. Unleash increases efficiency and gives teams _full control_ of how and when they enable new functionality for end users. Unleash lets teams ship code to production in _smaller_ releases _whenever_ they want.

Feature toggles make it easy to test how your code works with real production data without the fear that you'll accidentally break your users' experience. It also helps your team work on multiple features in parallel without each maintaining an separate feature branch.

Unleash is the largest open source solution for feature flagging on GitHub. There's 12 official client and server SDKs and 10+ community SDKs available; you can even make your own if you want to. You can use Unleash with any language and any framework.

<br/>

## Get started in 2 steps

### 1. Start Unleash

With [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) and [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) installed, it's easy to get started:

Run this script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Unleash/unleash-docker.git
cd unleash-docker
docker compose up -d
```

Then point your browser to `localhost:4242` and log in using:

- username: `admin`
- password: `unleash4all`

If you'd rather run the source code in this repo directly via Node.js, see the [step-by-step instructions to get up and running in the contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-run-the-project).

### 2. Connect your SDK

Find your preferred SDK in [our list of official SDKs](#unleash-sdks) and import it into your project. Follow the setup guides for your specific SDK.

If you use the docker compose file from the previous step, here's the configuration details you'll need to get going:

- For front-end SDKs, use:
  - URL: `http://localhost:3000`
  - `clientKey`: `proxy-client-key`
- For server-side SDKs, use:
  - Unleash API URL: `http://localhost:4242/api/`
  - API token: `default:development.unleash-insecure-api-token`

If you use a different setup, your configuration details will most likely also be different.

### Check a feature toggle

Checking the state of a feature toggle in your code is easy! The syntax will vary depending on your language, but all you need is a simple function call to check whether a toggle is available. Here's how it might look in Java:

```java
if (unleash.isEnabled("AwesomeFeature")) {
  // do new, flashy thing
} else {
  // do old, boring stuff
}
```

### Run Unleash on a service?

If you don't want to run Unleash locally, we also provide easy deployment setups for Heroku and Digital Ocean:

[![Deploy to Heroku](./.github/deploy-heroku-20.png)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy/?template=https://github.com/Unleash/unleash) [![Deploy to DigitalOcean](./.github/deploy-digital.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/tree/main&refcode=0e1d75187044)

### Configure and run Unleash anywhere

The above sections show you how to get up and running quickly and easily. When you're ready to start configuring and customizing Unleash for your own environment, check out the documentation for [getting started with self-managed deployments](https://docs.getunleash.io/deploy/getting_started), [Unleash configuration options](https://docs.getunleash.io/deploy/configuring_unleash), or [running Unleash locally via docker](https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/quickstart#i-want-to-run-unleash-locally).

## Features our users love

### Flexibility and adaptability

- Get an easy overview of all feature toggles across all your environments, applications and services
- Use included [activation strategies](https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/activation_strategy) for most common use cases, or use a [custom activation strategy](https://docs.getunleash.io/advanced/custom_activation_strategy) to support any need you might have
- Organise feature toggles by [feature toggle tags](https://docs.getunleash.io/advanced/tags)
- [Canary releases / gradual rollouts](https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/activation_strategy#gradual-rollout)
- Targeted releases: release features to specific [users](https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/activation_strategy#userids), [IPs](https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/activation_strategy#ips), or [hostnames](https://docs.getunleash.io/user_guide/activation_strategy#hostnames)
