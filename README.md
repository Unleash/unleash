# Unleash – Multi-Project Support (Community Fork)

A community-maintained fork of [Unleash](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash), the open-source feature flag platform.

This fork introduces **multi-project support**, allowing feature toggles to be managed in isolated, project-scoped environments — a feature not currently available in the upstream open-source version.

This fork is derived from the **latest Unleash open-source version (`v6.10.0`).

This version is independently maintained and **not officially supported by the Unleash maintainers**.
