# This docker compose setup configures:
# - the Unleash server instance + the necessary backing Postgres database
# - the Unleash proxy
#
# To learn more about all the parts of Unleash, visit
# https://docs.getunleash.io
#
# NOTE: please do not use this configuration for production setups.
# Unleash does not take responsibility for any data leaks or other
# problems that may arise as a result.
#
# This is intended to be used for demo, development, and learning
# purposes only.
