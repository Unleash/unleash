title: Addons Introduction
---

> This feature was introduced in _Unleash v3.11.0_.

Unleash Addons allows you to extend Unleash with new functionality. Currently addons allow you to listen to changes in Unleash and trigger updates in other systems, typical via a WebHook.

Currently Unleash support the following Addons out of the box:

- [Webhook](./webhook) - A generic way to post messages from Unleash to third party services.
- [Slack](./slack) - Allows Unleash to post updates to Slack.
- [Jira Commenter](./jira-commenter) - Allows Unleash to post comments to jira issues (beta).

In future releases we plan to support community built addons.
