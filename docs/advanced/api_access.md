It is possible to integrate directly with the Admin API. In this guide we will explain all the steps to set it up.

## Step 1: Create API token

Please refer to [Create token](../user_guide/api-token) on how to create an API token. You'll need a token with `Admin` level access for this to work.

Please note that it may take up to 60 seconds for the new key to propagate to all Unleash-hosted instances.

> If you need an API token to use in a client SDK you should create a "client token" as these have less access.

## Step 2: Use Admin API

Now that you have an access token with admin privileges we can use that to perform changes in our Unleash-hosted instance.

In the example below we will use the [Unleash Admin API](../api/admin/features) to enable the “Demo” feature toggle sing curl.

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: admintoken"
https://app.unleash-hosted.com/demo/api/admin/features/Demo/toggle/on
```

**Great success!** We have now enabled the feature toggle. We can also verify that it was actually changed by the API user by navigating to the history (audit log) for this feature toggle.
