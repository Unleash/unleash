# OTHER API DOCS
# Could do withe an overview. What is it? What does it do? Who is it for? Why would I use this? For a good example, see https://ionicframework.com/docs or https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-index#index
# Getting started - I have made some tweaks to this but it would be handy to also provide some JS code to make an example API call. PUT /admin​/features​/{featureName} is a good choice (since it has both a Request body and a query parameter). Twilio is brilliant example of this kind of stuff. https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart
# Status and error codes - It would be useful to generate a simple table listing all status codes. See how Clearbit does it: https://clearbit.com/docs?python#errors
# Rate limiting and thresholds - Need to inform people of this even if it's not a 'thing', they will ask. See https://unleash-community.slack.com/archives/CGP2MCHPF/p1603106990003200 See how Twitter API describes their limits: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits
# Glossary - Need definitions for, as a start, the project specific stuff: Unleash server, Unleash client, Feature Toggle, Strategy, Variant, Diff. Doesn't need to be massive. For instance, see the Lyft glossary - https://developer.lyft.com/docs/glossary
# Reference - Is the guidance on the documentation site complete? Add 'workflows': tasks that bundle several API calls to achieve common goals. Check Unleash Slack channel for potential examples
# TESTING
# QA team test cases. Test code exists but were these based on a list of steps required to produce a result?
# Are there any real-world users of Unleash who are happy to read and test the Open API specification and make suggestions for improvement? Would they be happy to screen-record what they are doing (how they use the API will give invaluable insights)?
# Ideally, you'd want developers using Java, Node.js, Go, Ruby, Python and .Net to test
# Could there be a simple sample app that implemented all API calls (using realistic scenarios)? Might just be a consolidated version of the tests/e2e code with some triggers (buttons) and some UI to display outcomes.
# OAS REVIEW
# Move responses to root responses section in components (from schema section)
# Issues with rendering as nested externaldocs from Swagger UI. See GET /admin​/feature-types. Not an issue in other tools (see redoc.html)
# Create output in other non-Swagger styles (as well as Redoc) - such as Readme
# Other candidates for $ref: createdAt, lastSeen/updatedAt
# REDOC
# 'Try it out' instructions do not apply since the free version of Redoc has no such feature. 
# STYLE
# Add style guide MD. UK/US = US, Newspaper/Movie, Plurals. &. What 's the closest match for Unleash? http://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/
# OAS styler - Only use backticks for code samples and API paths. Use bold for schema items and italic for schema item settings

  description: |-
    Unleash is an open source feature flag and toggle system for all your applications and services.

    Once you have [set your Unleash server up](https://unleash.github.io/docs/getting_started), you can test the API from inside your browser. The following assumes the server is running on localhost:4242.

    The following 'endpoints' (such as `GET /admin/metrics/applications`) provide reference documentation for the Unleash REST API. To try out API calls:
    1. Expand an endpoint
    2. Click **Try it out**
    3. Customize the **Request body** and/or **Parameters**.
    4. Click **Execute**.

    You will see the cURL request submitted to the API server and the corresponding response.

    Alternatively, you can test the API in [Postman](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/8552ddcd4cc9fc012548)
