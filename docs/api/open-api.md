title: Open API Specification
---

> The Unleash Open API Specifications are still considered a beta functionality. We have (for now) manually written all the specifications for all API endpoints. We are testing this functionality, and the ultimate goal will be to auto-generate these specifications from the code itself.

The Open API Specification is hosted as part of the online demo: http://unleash.herokuapp.com/oas/

You can also allow your own Unleash instance to serve the Open API specification by setting the `ENABLE_OAS` environment variable to true: `ENABLE_OAS=true`
