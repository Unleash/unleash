# Version 4 specifications

Here we document features planned for Unleash version 4 and progress for each client SDK. Client SDKs should be able to introduce all features as a minor rev 3. release, and should switch to a version 4.x revision when all features are supported. This makes it easier for the Users to navigate supported features in respecitve clients.
