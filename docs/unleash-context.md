title: Unleash Context
---

In order to standardise a few activation strategies we also needed to standardise a unleash context, which contains some fields that varies per requests, needed to implement the activation strategies.

The unleash context is defined by these fields:

- userId: String,
- sessionId: String,
- remoteAddress: String,
- properties: Map<String, String>

All fields are optional, but if they are not set you will not be able to use certain activation strategies.

E.g. the userWithId-strategy obviously depends on the userId field.

The properties field is more generic and can be used to provide more abritary data to the strategies. A common usage is to add more metadata, e.g. that the current user is a beta user, and thus the betaUser-strategy will use this info in its implementation.
