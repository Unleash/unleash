      summary: Fetches all feature toggles from the Unleash server.
      description: |
        The response returns all active feature toggles and their current strategy configuration:
        - A feature toggle will have *at least* one configured strategy.
        - A strategy will have a `name` and `parameters` map.

        **Note:** To only return one Feature Toggle, add the Feature Toggle name as a suffix to the request. For example: `GET [Your host]/api/admin/features/featureX`. It is not possible to add this parameter as a *Try it out* option due to restrictions in the [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/), (that is, *optional* path variables cannot be created).
