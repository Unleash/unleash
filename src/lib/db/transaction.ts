/**
 * @deprecated this is a temporary solution to deal with transactions at the store level.
 * Ideally, we should handle transactions at the service level (each service method should be transactional).
 * The controller should define the transactional scope as follows:
 * https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/blob/cb034976b93abc799df774858d716a49f645d669/src/lib/features/export-import-toggles/export-import-controller.ts#L206-L208
 *
 * To be able to use .transactional method, services should be instantiated like this:
 * https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/blob/cb034976b93abc799df774858d716a49f645d669/src/lib/services/index.ts#L282-L284
 *
 * This function makes sure that `fn` is executed in a transaction.
 * If the db is already in a transaction, it will execute `fn` in that transactional scope.
 *
