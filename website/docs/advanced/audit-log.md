@Thomas - should we call the page Event log instead? and replace all the text "audit log" with -> "event log"?
The audit log lets you track changes in Unleash. It lists _what_ changed, _when_ it changed, and _who_ performed the change.

## Feature toggle log {#audit-log-per-feature-toggle}

Each feature toggle has its own audit log. The audit log is available under the "Event log" tab in the tab view.

## Global Audit Log {#global-audit-log}

Unleash also keeps an audit log across all toggles and activation strategies, tracking all changes. You access the global audit log via the “Event log”, which you can find in the drawer menu. The global audit log is only accessible by users with instance admin access.
