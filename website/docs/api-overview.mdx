## Frontend API

## Client API

## Admin API 

How to use the Admin API
## Create API token

First, you'll need to create a [personal access token](/reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx#personal-access-tokens).

Please note that it may take up to 60 seconds for the new key to propagate to all Unleash instances due to eager caching.

:::note

If you need an API token to use in a client SDK you should create a client token instead, as these have fewer access rights.

:::

## Use Admin API

Now that you have an access token with admin privileges, you can use it to make changes in your Unleash instance.

In the example below we will use the [Unleash Admin API](/reference/api/legacy/unleash/admin/features.md) to enable the `checkout-flow` feature flag in `development` using curl.

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: <your-token>" \
     https://app.unleash-hosted.com/docs-demo/api/admin/projects/docs-project/features/checkout-flow/environments/development/on
```

We have now enabled the feature flag. We can also verify that it was actually changed by the API user by navigating to [Event Log](/reference/events#event-log) and filtering events for this feature flag.

You can find the full documentation on everything the Unleash API supports in the [Unleash API documentation](/reference/api/legacy/unleash/admin/features.md).


## Enable and access the OpenAPI specification

:::note Availability

**Unleash version**: `4.13+`

:::

The Unleash server provides an OpenAPI specification that describes its APIs. This specification is useful for understanding the API, generating client libraries, or for testing purposes.

For self-hosted Unleash v5.2+, the OpenAPI specification endpoint is enabled by default. For older self-hosted versions, use the `ENABLE_OAS` [environment variable](/using-unleash/deploy/configuring-unleash) to enable it.

You can access the OpenAPI specification from your Unleash instance URL.

- **JSON Specification:**
    - Path: `/docs/openapi.json`
    - This provides the raw OpenAPI specification in JSON format.

- **Swagger UI (interactive documentation):**
    - Path: `/docs/openapi/`
    - This provides an interactive UI where you can explore and test the API endpoints.
