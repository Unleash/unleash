Your Unleash [plan](#plans) and [version](#versioning) determine what features you have access to. Our documentation displays the availability for each feature using the following annotation:

:::note Availability

**Plan**: [Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) | **Version**: `5.7+`

:::

This is an example of a feature that is only available to Enterprise customers who are on version `5.7` or later.

## Plans

- [Open Source](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) - Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash) under an Apache 2.0 license.
- Pro - Currently not offered.
- [Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) - Available as Pay-as-you-go or as an annual contract, as cloud-hosted or self-hosted.

## Beta features

Some new Unleash features are tagged as `BETA` in the documentation. This means that the feature may be subject to change or discontinuation. Unleash may decide to enable such features for a select number of customers only. If you're interested in trying out a beta feature, please reach out to Customer Success at beta@getunleash.io.

## Versioning

Unleash uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with release notes available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash/releases). For detailed instructions on upgrading your version, see [Upgrading Unleash](../using-unleash/deploy/upgrading-unleash).

[Unleash Edge](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-edge) and our [SDKs](/reference/sdks) are versioned and released independently of Unleash. We recommend upgrading your SDKs and Unleash Edge to the latest versions to ensure compatibility, optimal performance, and access to the latest features and security updates.
