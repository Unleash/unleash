## Quick suggestions

When you open the Command Menu, it displays the last five pages you visited, whether they are features, projects, or other types of pages. This allows you to resume your recent work without having to manually navigate back to those pages.

## Page navigation

The Command Menu includes a list of all available pages, enabling quick navigation. This feature is particularly useful when you need to move swiftly between different sections of Unleash.

## Keyboard shortcuts

To facilitate a mouse-free workflow, the Command Menu can be accessed using a keyboard shortcut:

- **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + K`
- **macOS**: `Cmd + K`

This allows you to bring up the Command Menu instantly, ensuring that you can maintain your flow without interruption.

## Search functionality

The Command Menu's search feature allows you to quickly find flags, projects, and pages based on your input. The search returns the following:

- **Feature flags**: The first three feature flags that match your input. The search also includes descriptions, which are displayed when you hover over a feature flag in the dropdown list.
- **Projects**: The first three projects matching the search input.
- **Pages**: Any page that contains the input text.

This search functionality is designed to be comprehensive, allowing you to find what you need based on various criteria, including text within descriptions.

## Feature request capability

If your search query does not return any results, you can request new features using the **Suggest capability** button.
