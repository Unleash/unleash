:::note Availability

**Plan**: [Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) | **Version**: `7.4+`

:::

[Enterprise Edge](/unleash-edge) observability provides deep visibility into the health and performance of your Unleash Edge nodes directly within the Admin UI.

This feature enables you to monitor the real-time state of every connected Edge instance, helping you identify bottlenecks, verify regional deployments, and ensure your Edge nodes are properly synced.

## View your Edge observability dashboard

To access the Enterprise Edge observability dashboard, go to **Admin settings > Enterprise Edge** in the Unleash Admin UI.

## Metrics and information

The dashboard reports the following metrics for each Edge node:

### Instance details

- **Region**: The hosting region where the Edge instance is deployed.
- **Instance ID**: Unique identifier for the Edge instance.
- **Upstream server**: Whether the instance connects to Unleash or another Edge node.
- **Hosting type**: Whether the instance is hosted (managed by Unleash) or [self-hosted](/unleash-edge/deploy) (managed by you).

### Instance health

- **Status**: Current connection state (for example, `Connected`) with start time and last reported connection.
- **Version**: The running version of the Edge binary.
- **Resources**: Real-time CPU and memory usage.

### Traffic and performance

- **Stream clients**: Number of SDKs currently maintaining a streaming connection to this Edge instance.
- **Upstream latency**: Time taken to fetch updates from the upstream Unleash server, broken down by:
  - Client Features
  - Metrics
  - Edge sync
- **Downstream latency**: Time taken to serve requests to connected SDKs, broken down by:
  - Frontend evaluations
  - Backend evaluations

These metrics help you identify performance bottlenecks, verify that your Edge nodes are properly distributed across regions, and ensure that configuration updates are being synced efficiently.
