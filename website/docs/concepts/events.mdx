## Overview

Events help you keep track of changes across your Unleash instance. You can explore events in [Event Log](#event-log) or using the global [Event Timeline](#event-timeline).

The Event Log provides a full list of all events, whereas the Event Timeline offers a highlight of recent key events and [Signals](/concepts/signals) from external sources.
You can use Event Log for auditing purposes, while Event Timeline is particularly helpful for debugging recent changes and their impact.

## Event Log

The Event Log lists all events in your Unleash instance. You can search and filter events by date range, event type, project, feature flag, and user. You can also export events as CSV or JSON files.

To access events in the Admin UI, you need Admin access. To view all events, go to **Admin settings > Event log**. To view events for a specific feature flag, go to the **Event log** tab on that feature flag's page.

Each [event type](#event-types) contains different data, but all events follow the same schema:


| Field              | Type   | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`*              | number | Unique identifier for the event; incremental whole number.        |
| `groupId`*         | string | Identifier that links related events created by a single action, such as through a [change request](/concepts/change-requests). Added in Unleash 7.1.    |
| `type`*            | string | Describes the type of event (e.g., `feature-strategy-update`).    |
| `createdAt`*       | string | Timestamp when the event was created; ISO 8601 format.            |
| `createdBy`*       | string | Email of the user who triggered the event.                        |
| `createdByUserId` | number | Unique identifier of the user who triggered the event.            |
| `data`             | object | Details about the event (e.g., feature strategy, API token data). |
| `preData`          | object | Previous state before the event.                                  |
| `tags`             | array  | Array of tags associated with the event.                          |
| `featureName`      | string | Name of the feature flag associated with the event.               |
| `project`          | string | Name of the project involved in the event.                        |
| `environment`      | string | Environment related to the event (e.g., `development`).           |
| `label`            | string | Brief description of the event.                                   |
| `summary`          | string | Markdown formatted summary of the event.                          |


Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are always returned in the event schema. Other fields may be optional or have null values, depending on the event type.

See the [feature-created event type](#feature-created) for an example event.

### IP address

:::note Availability

**Plan**: [Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/plans/enterprise) | **Version**: `6.9+`

:::

The IP address in events shows the IP address of the user who performed the action.

## Event Timeline

:::note Availability

**Plan**: [Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/plans/enterprise) | **Version**: `6.3+` in BETA

:::

Event Timeline highlights recent events across all your projects in one unified timeline. You can access the timeline from the top menu in the Admin UI.

![Event timeline in Unleash Admin UI](/img/event-timeline.png)

The timeline shows key events and signals for up to 48 hours per environment and is designed to help you get an overview of changes and quickly identify and debug any issues. You can switch between different time spans to focus on recent activity.
Although you can filter events by environment, the timeline also shows environment-agnostic events, such as archiving a feature flag.

You can enable or disable the timeline view at any time based on your preferences. Events that occur close together in time are automatically grouped, but hovering over an event group shows detailed information about the specific events.
