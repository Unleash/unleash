## Introduction {#introduction}

This repository consists of two main parts: the backend and frontend of Unleash. The backend is a Node.js application built with TypeScript, while the frontend is a React application also built with TypeScript. You can find code specific to the backend in the `src` lib folder and code specific to the frontend in the `frontend` folder.

## Development philosophy

The development philosophy at Unleash is centered on delivering high-quality software. We achieve this by following a set of principles that we believe will also make the software easy to maintain and extend, serving as our guide.

We believe that the following principles are essential in achieving our goal:

- Testing code always: Software engineering is challenging, and it's crucial to take every precaution necessary to avoid introducing bugs. Thus, testing is an effective way to accomplish this aim. We prefer automation over manual testing.
 
- Writing code that is easy to understand and maintain: Code serves as language â€“ a means of communicating intent with readers efficiently. Therefore, writing clean code matters significantly for us because it keeps our codebase manageable while maintaining speed in the long run.

- Considering solutions before committing: Rather than jumping straight into implementation, we examine how various scenarios may affect a particular solution concerning the problem at hand's impact. As our product core is open source-oriented, balancing solutions without burdening communities becomes vital; improving paid offerings should never come at Open-source offering cost.
