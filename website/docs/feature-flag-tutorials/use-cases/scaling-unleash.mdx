import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

When evaluating Unleash for enterprise-wide adoption, your primary concerns likely revolve around scalability, performance, and availability. You need assurance that the chosen feature management system can handle potentially tens of millions of users and millions of flags across numerous regions, without compromising user experience or introducing system fragility.

This guide explains how Unleash is architected to meet these demands, focusing on:
- **Global scale**: Handling distributed traffic efficiently across multiple regions.
- **Resilience**: Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance to prevent outages.
- **Performance**: Delivering low-latency flag evaluations for a seamless user experience.

We'll explore Unleash's core architecture and the mechanisms that enable effective scaling, ensuring high performance and resilience, even under significant load. We will cover deployment options, reference architectures, and best practices for enterprise environments.

## Unleash core architecture 

Unleash is fundamentally designed for speed and resilience. Understanding these core principles is key to grasping how it scales effectively.

![Architecture using Enterprise Edge](/img/architecture-enterprise-edge.png)

### Fast, local feature flag evaluation
SDKs embedded in your applications fetch feature flag configurations from the Unleash API or Unleash Edge. Backend SDKs perform flag evaluations locally within the application's memory. This eliminates network latency for each evaluation, resulting in extremely fast checks. Frontend SDKs rely on Unleash Edge as a fast, lightweight caching and evaluation layer closer to the end-user.

### Resilience through caching
SDKs cache the last known valid configuration. If the Unleash API or Unleash Edge becomes temporarily unavailable, the SDK continues operating using these cached flags and predefined default values, ensuring your application remains functional and resilient to network interruptions or upstream service issues.

For a deeper dive, explore the Unleash architecture overview. 

## Choosing the right deployment option
How you set up Unleash to scale depends significantly on the hosting option you choose. Unleash offers flexible deployment models to match your operational preferences and requirements. Letâ€™s recap the three main options.

<Tabs groupId="unleash-deployment-options">

<TabItem value="unleash-cloud" label="Unleash Cloud">

- **How it works**: Unleash manages the entire infrastructure stack (Unleash API server, database, Admin UI, Unleash Enterprise Edge) on a robust, multi-region AWS setup designed for high availability and performance.
- **Ideal for**: Teams wanting to focus on feature delivery, minimize operational overhead, and leverage Unleash's expertise in scaling and managing the platform. Offers the fastest time-to-value.
- **Scaling and infrastructure**: Leverages a globally distributed Hosted Edge network for low latency. Includes automatic scaling, Multi-AZ deployments, managed databases with automatic failover, CDN for UI assets, and built-in disaster recovery. Handles traffic bursts seamlessly. Customizable Edge regions are available.
- **Key tradeoff**: Less direct control over the underlying infrastructure compared to self-hosting, in exchange for significantly reduced operational burden.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="unleash-self-hosted" label="Unleash self-hosted">

- **How it works**: You deploy, manage, and scale all Unleash components (Unleash API server, database, Admin UI, Unleash Enterprise Edge) within your own infrastructure (cloud or on-premises).
- **Ideal for**: Organizations with strict regulatory environments requiring full data/infrastructure control, air-gapped networks, or those with strong preferences and capabilities for managing their own software infrastructure.
- **Scaling and infrastructure**: You are responsible for architecting for high availability (e.g., Multi-AZ API deployment, database clusters), scaling compute resources, database capacity planning, backups, disaster recovery strategies, monitoring, and security updates.
- **Key tradeoff**: Maximum control over data and infrastructure, at the cost of significant SRE/DevOps expertise, resources, and ongoing operational effort.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="hybrid" label="Hybrid">

- **How it works**: You use the managed Unleash Cloud for the core platform (API server, database, Admin UI) but deploy and manage Unleash Edge instances yourself within your own network perimeter. SDKs connect to your self-hosted Edge.
- **Ideal for**: Teams needing the operational ease of a managed core platform but requiring absolute control over where end-user context is evaluated (e.g., for data privacy, residency regulations) by keeping Edge within their network boundaries.
- **Scaling and infrastructure**: Unleash manages the core API/DB scaling and availability. You manage the Edge instance lifecycle, including its deployment, scaling, monitoring, and high-availability setup within your environment.
- **Key tradeoff**: Provides granular control over Edge data processing and network placement while reducing the operational overhead of managing the core Unleash API and database. Still requires expertise and resources to operate Edge reliably at scale.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Scaling Unleash
The key components requiring scaling consideration are the Unleash API server, and its database.

- **Unleash API server**: This component is a Node.js-based, stateless API. It can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances behind a load balancer, ideally across different Availability Zones (Multi-AZ). Utilize Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) or similar mechanisms in cloud environments (like AWS, Azure, GCP) to automatically adjust capacity based on load metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage, request count).
- **Database**: The database stores all configurations, feature flags, strategies, context fields, metrics, and audit logs. It is the critical stateful component. The database layer must be performant and highly available. Use managed database services (like AWS RDS, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud SQL) configured for high availability.
- **Unleash Frontend / Admin UI**: An interface for managing feature flags, strategies, context fields, users, API tokens, and more. Use a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and serve static assets for fast loading times worldwide.

![How we scale Unleash](/img/scaling-unleash.png)

### How we scale Unleash Cloud
#### Horizontal scaling
We run Unleash API instances across multiple AWS Availability Zones (Multi-AZ). Load balancers distribute incoming traffic, and auto-scaling groups automatically adjust the number of instances based on observed load.

#### Database resilience
We use AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) configured for high availability with Multi-AZ deployments, providing automatic failover to a hot standby in case the primary database instance or its AZ fails.

#### Regional disaster recovery
Full backups are stored in a separate region. A standby Unleash cluster in the backup region can take over in the rare event of a complete primary region failure.

#### CDN for UI assets
The Admin UI's static assets are served via a global CDN for fast loading worldwide.

#### Handling bursts
Our managed environment is designed for elasticity. Auto-scaling adjusts resources automatically. We continuously monitor load and performance metrics, allowing the system (and our SRE team) to handle sudden traffic peaks, such as those from product launches or marketing campaigns, ensuring consistent performance.

<details>
  <summary>Handling traffic peaks with self-hosted Unleash</summary>

  When self-hosting, we recommend that you implement the following:
    - Auto-scaling for your Unleash API and Unleash Edge instances based on relevant metrics (CPU, memory, request latency).
    - A database configuration (instance size, IOPS, connection pool) that can handle peak load. Monitor performance closely.
    - Pre-warming strategy for instances or scaling capacity proactively before known high-traffic events.
</details>

### Self-hosting Unleash: Designing for high availability

When designing for high availability and resilience in a self-hosted environment, we recommend that you implement the following strategies:

#### Multi-AZ deployments
We recommend running the Unleash API nodes in at least two different Availability Zones within a single region. Place these instances behind a load balancer that distributes traffic across the healthy instances in different AZs.

Key benefits:
- Reduces single point of failure within a region.
- Supports zero-downtime maintenance and upgrades.
- Allows for auto-scaling based on CPU/memory or request latency.

#### Databases and Replication
For enterprise-scale deployments, a robust, managed service (such as AWS RDS for PostgreSQL) is recommended. 

Configure the following:
- Multi-AZ deployment for automatic failover within the primary region.
- A cross-region read replica or maintain continuous backups shipped to a secondary region for disaster recovery purposes.
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) to handle accidental data deletion or corruption scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Database sizing recommendation</summary>

    A starting point for the database could be an instance with 2 vCPUs, 2-4 GiB RAM, and at least 20-30 GiB of fast SSD storage (e.g., similar to AWS RDS `db.t4g.small` or `db.m6g.large` depending on expected load).
    
    Monitor key database metrics: CPU utilization, memory usage, available storage, IOPS (read/write), active connections, query latency/throughput, and replication lag (if applicable).
    
    Scale the database instance vertically (to a larger instance size) or horizontally (by adding read replicas, if your workload permits) based on observed bottlenecks.
    
    Read more details in the self-hosting guide.
</details>


#### Handling failover
Configure automatic failover for your database (managed services typically handle this). Failover within a region (Multi-AZ) should ideally complete in less than a few minutes. Ensure full database backups are regularly taken and stored securely, preferably in a separate region.

In the rare event of a complete primary region failure (disaster recovery scenario):
1. Promote the database read replica (or restore from backup) in the standby region to become the new primary database.
2. Adjust DNS records or load balancer configurations to direct traffic to the Unleash API instances in the new region.
3. Scale up compute resources (API servers, Edge instances if applicable) in the new region as needed to handle the full production load.

## Scaling with Unleash Edge
For organizations with globally distributed users and a high number of client-side (e.g., web/mobile) flag evaluations, relying solely on a central Unleash API server can introduce unacceptable latency for end-users and place significant read load on the central API and database.

Unleash Edge acts as a lightweight, globally distributed, read-only caching layer for your feature flag configurations. SDKs connect to the nearest Edge instance instead of directly to the central Unleash API.

Edge was specifically built to handle scenarios where tens of millions of end-users are spread across the globe, requiring localized evaluation of feature toggles with minimal latency.

### Why use Edge?
- **Low latency**: Dramatically reduces flag configuration fetch times for users worldwide by serving requests from a geographically closer point. With Enterprise Edge, feature flag updates are pushed instantly from the central API to the Edge nodes, ensuring they serve near-real-time configurations.
- **Scalability**: Edge instances are stateless and optimized for high throughput. They can be scaled horizontally, independently of the main Unleash API. This offloads the vast majority of read traffic (SDK polling/requests) from your central Unleash API and database. A single Edge instance can typically handle tens of thousands of requests per second.
- **Enhanced availability**: Edge instances maintain an in-memory cache of the flag configuration. If the central Unleash API is temporarily unavailable, Edge continues to serve the last known valid configuration to SDKs, providing an additional layer of resilience beyond the SDK's own cache.

### Global scale and multi-region scenarios

When you require low-latency flag evaluations for a globally distributed user base, we recommend that you use distributed Edge instances across multiple global regions.

![How we scale Unleash Edge](/img/scaling-edge.png)

With Unleash Enterprise Edge Cloud, this complexity is handled for youâ€”you simply configure your SDKs with the provided Edge URL. We ensure that:
- Edge instances run across multiple global regions with at least two AZs within each region.
- SDKs automatically connect to the nearest available region. Traffic fails over to other regions if one region becomes unavailable.
- Edge nodes are always up to date due to streaming, SDKs connected to Edge can continue evaluating flags even if the connection to the primary Unleash API server is temporarily lost.


<details>
  <summary>Self-hosting Unleash Edge</summary>

    For a standard production configuration when self-hosting Edge, we recommend the following:

    Run in Edge mode: This mode connects to your upstream Unleash API server (cloud-hosted or self-hosted) to synchronize feature flags, segments, and API tokens required for evaluations. This is the default mode for most production use cases.

    Start Edge with initialization tokens: Specify a list of client or frontend API tokens during Edge startup (e.g., via environment variables). Edge will use these tokens to pre-fetch ("hydrate") the necessary flag configurations immediately upon starting. This ensures Edge can respond instantly to SDK requests without needing to fetch data on demand for the first request associated with a given token. This is crucial for predictable performance, especially when running multiple Edge instances behind a load balancer serving frontend API requests.
    
    Use the built-in readiness and health checks: Integrate /health (basic health) and /ready (ready to serve traffic, including initial hydration) endpoints with your load balancer and orchestration system (e.g., Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes) to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy and fully initialized Edge instances.
    
    Read more in the Unleash Edge deployment guide.
</details>

### Lower scale or single-region scenarios

Even when global scaling and sub-second cross-continent latency are not primary concerns initially, implementing basic high-availability practices is still recommended for production workloads:
- SDKs connect directly to the Unleash API behind a load balancer or use a local Unleash Edge instance.
- The load balancer should distribute requests across Unleash API instances running in multiple AZs for redundancy.
- A Multi-AZ managed database ensures high availability at the database layer.

## Monitoring and observability

Unleash Cloud provides built-in observability dashboards, usage metrics, and system status updates via the Admin UI and a public status page.

Underlying infrastructure monitoring, alerting, and scaling are handled by Unleash SREs.

The **Network** dashboard in the Admin UI, including the **Connected Edges** view, provides detailed observability metrics for Unleash Edge instances, such as ID, region, resource usage, latency.

<details>
  <summary>Self-hosted observability</summary>

    - Health checks: Poll `/health` endpoints on API and Edge instances. Monitor `/internal-backstage/prometheus` on Edge if applicable.
    - API/Edge instances: Track CPU, memory, network, request latency, and error rates.
    - Database: Monitor key performance indicators such as CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O (IOPS), network throughput, active connections, query latency/throughput, replication lag (if applicable), and available disk space.
    - Application logs: Enhance default logging (JSON recommended) and centralize (e.g., CloudWatch Logs, Datadog, Splunk).
    - Alerting: Configure alerts based on critical thresholds: high error rates, sustained high latency, unhealthy instances (failing health checks), low disk space (database or instance), high database replication lag, high resource utilization (CPU/memory).
</details>

Unleash is architected with scalability, performance, and resilience in mind, designed specifically for supporting demanding enterprise workloads. By leveraging its client-side evaluation architecture, Unleash Edge for added scalability, and flexible deployment models, organizations can achieve reliable, high-performance feature management at a global scale, enabling faster, safer software delivery.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
This FAQ section addresses common questions about scaling the Unleash feature management platform for enterprise use, focusing on performance, high availability, and managing large user and flag volumes.

#### Should I choose cloud-hosted or self-hosted Unleash?
Choosing a hosting option depends on several factors such as: your organization's tolerance for operational overhead, requirements for data residency and infrastructure control, regulatory compliance needs (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP), available SRE/DevOps resources and expertise, and desired speed of implementation (time-to-value).

We generally recommend Unleash Cloud for most enterprises due to reduced operational complexity, built-in high-availability and disaster recovery, and managed scaling by Unleash experts. Choose self-hosted or hybrid if specific control, network isolation (air-gapped), or strict regulatory requirements mandate it.

#### How does Unleash ensure fast feature flag checks without slowing down user experience?
Unleash achieves speed primarily through its client-side SDKs.

- **Local evaluation**: Your application integrates an Unleash SDK. This SDK periodically fetches flag configurations from the Unleash API or Unleash Edge. Crucially, the evaluation of which flags apply to a specific user happens instantly within your application's memory using the fetched rules and the context you provide (like user ID, location, etc.).
- **No network calls per flag check**: Because evaluation is local, there's no network latency added for each feature flag check during a user's request processing. This makes flag evaluation extremely fast.
- **SDK caching**: SDKs securely cache the latest known flag configuration. This ensures evaluations continue even if the connection to Unleash is temporarily lost.

#### How does Unleash handle scaling for potentially tens of millions of users and sudden traffic peaks (like a product launch or marketing campaign)?
Unleash Cloud is architected on AWS for high availability and elasticity:
- **Multi-AZ deployment**: Services run across multiple Availability Zones within a region for fault tolerance.
- **Auto scaling**: We use load balancers and auto-scaling groups for the Unleash API instances, automatically adjusting capacity based on real-time traffic load.
- **Managed databases**: Highly available managed databases (PostgreSQL) with hot standbys and automatic failover are used.
- **Global Edge network**: Hosted Unleash Edge distributes flag serving globally for low latency and high throughput.
- **Proactive monitoring and elasticity**: We continuously monitor performance and scale resources proactively to handle anticipated and sudden peaks smoothly.
- **Disaster recovery**: Full backups and a running cluster exist in a separate DR region for rare regional failure scenarios.

#### What is Unleash Edge and why would I need it?
Unleash Edge is a lightweight, globally distributable, read-only proxy/cache for your feature flag configurations. Think of it as a specialized distribution layer for feature flags.
You need it primarily for:
- **Low latency**: Serving flags from an Edge instance geographically closer to your users/applications drastically reduces lookup times, especially critical for frontend/mobile apps.
- **Scalability**: Edge handles the high volume of SDK requests (polls/fetches), offloading the central Unleash API and database, allowing the system to scale to millions of connections.
- **Availability**: Edge caches configurations and continues serving them even if the central Unleash API is temporarily offline, adding another layer of resilience beyond the SDK cache.

#### What are the key challenges of self-hosting Unleash at scale?
The main challenges include:
- **Database management**: Scaling, ensuring high availability (replication, failover), performing backups/restores, and optimizing performance for the stateful database component.
- **High availability**: Architecting and managing redundancy for all components (API servers, Edge instances, load balancers) across multiple AZs or even regions.
- **Global Edge deployment**: If needed, deploying, managing, routing traffic to, and monitoring Edge instances across multiple geographic locations adds complexity.
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Setting up comprehensive monitoring for all components (API, Edge, DB) and configuring meaningful alerts requires significant effort.
Operational Maintenance: Handling upgrades, security patching, dependency management, and capacity planning requires dedicated SRE/DevOps resources.

#### How does Unleash ensure fast flag evaluations?
The SDKs perform evaluations locally and rapidly using cached configuration data. Unleash Edge further ensures that the delivery of configuration updates to the SDKs happens with low latency, especially for globally distributed applications.

#### What happens if the Unleash API goes down? Will my application stop working?
No, your application will not stop working. The Unleash SDKs are designed for resilience:
- **Cached configuration**: The SDK will continue operating using the last successfully fetched set of feature flag rules stored in its cache.
- **Default values**: You define default values for flags within your code, which the SDK can use if it has no cached configuration or if a specific flag isn't present in the cache.
- **Unleash Edge**: Using Unleash Edge provides an additional layer of availability, serving flags even if the central Unleash API is down.

You can monitor Unleash Cloud's status via our public Status Page.

#### Why use Unleash Edge instead of just putting the main Unleash API in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)?
While ASGs scale the central Unleash API, Edge solves different problems:
- **Global latency**: ASGs don't solve latency for users far from the API's region. Edge brings flags geographically closer.
- **Central API resilience**: If the central API or its database has issues, all instances in the ASG might be affected. Edge instances can continue serving cached flags independently during such an outage.
- **Load distribution**: Edge is optimized specifically for the high-volume, read-heavy load from SDKs, protecting the core API (which handles writes, UI, and configuration logic).

#### Can Edge run in air-gapped environments?
Yes, self-hosted Unleash Edge can operate effectively in restricted or air-gapped environments. Once synced with an accessible Unleash API (which could also be self-hosted within the restricted network), Edge can serve cached flags locally even if disconnected, synchronizing again when connectivity is restored. Plan network routes carefully for initial and subsequent syncs.

#### Unleash Edge vs. Unleash Proxy: What's the difference?
Unleash Edge is the modern, high-performance, recommended successor to the legacy Unleash Proxy. Edge offers significant improvements in performance, scalability, real-time updates (via push mechanisms in Enterprise), and maintainability compared to the older Proxy component. New deployments should use Unleash Edge.

#### How does Unleash handle service outages?
Unleash Cloud is designed for high availability:

- **Within a region**: Automatic failover across multiple Availability Zones for components like the API server and database. Managed database failover typically completes in under 2 minutes.
- **Regional outages**: A comprehensive disaster recovery strategy involves regular backups and the capability to restore service in a secondary backup region in the rare event of a complete primary region failure. Self-hosted setups require you to implement similar HA and DR strategies.

#### How much traffic can Unleash handle?
Unleash, particularly when deployed with Unleash Edge, is designed to handle very high traffic volumes, suitable for large-scale enterprise applications.

- **Unleash Edge**: A single Edge instance can typically handle tens of thousands of requests per second. The overall capacity scales horizontally by adding more Edge instances globally.
- **Unleash API**: The central API can scale horizontally using ASGs. Its capacity depends on the instance sizes and number of instances deployed.
- **Unleash Cloud**: Our cloud infrastructure is built and tested to handle billions of flag evaluations per month across our customer base, scaling automatically to meet demand.

The limiting factor in self-hosted deployments is typically the performance and scalability of the underlying database and the number/size of API/Edge instances deployed.
