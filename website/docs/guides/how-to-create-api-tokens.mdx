All Unleash APIs require authentication using an [API token](/concepts/api-tokens-and-client-keys). The type of token you use depends on the API you are accessing and your specific use case.

### Token types

Unleash supports four types of API tokens:
- **Backend tokens**: Used to connect backend SDKs, Unleash Edge, and the Unleash Proxy to the Client API. Can be scoped to a specific project and environment.
- **Frontend tokens**: Used to connect frontend SDKs to the Frontend API or Unleash Edge. These tokens are designed to be publicly accessible and have limited permissions. Can be scoped to a specific project and environment.
- **Personal access tokens**: Tied to a specific user account. They are useful for testing, debugging, or providing temporary access to tools and scripts that need to interact with the Admin API.
- **Service account tokens**: The recommended method for providing API access to integrations, automation tools, and other non-human users. Service accounts provide a more secure and manageable way to grant Admin API access.

### Create an API token

Depending on your permissions, you can create API tokens in the Unleash Admin UI in four ways:

- **Admin settings > Access control > API access**: for client or frontend tokens; requires the Admin root role, or a custom root role with API token permissions.
- **Admin settings > Service accounts > New service account**: for creating a service account and assigning a token.
- **Settings > API access** [inside a project]: for project-specific client or frontend tokens; permitted for project Members or users with a corresponding root role.
- **Profile > View profile settings > Personal API tokens**: for personal access tokens.
