Environment cloning](../user_guide/environments.md#cloning-environments) enables Unleash admins to duplicate existing environments, including all feature toggles strategies and their state.

## Step 1: Navigate to the environments page {#step-1}

Navigate to the _Environments_ page in the admin UI (available at the URL `/environments`). Use the navigation menu item "Configure" and select "Environments".

## Step 3: Fill in the clone environment form {#step-3}

Give your new environment a name. The name must be unique and cannot be the same as the original environment. The name is pre-filled with a suggestion, but you can change it to whatever you like.

Select an environment type and select which projects should have their environment configuration cloned. Choose whether to keep the existing user permissions for the new environment or ... [what happens here?]

## Step 4 (optional): Generate a new API token {#step-4}

On the form, you also have the option to generate an API token right away. If you choose to do so, you will need to select the projects enabled for the new token. Once you submit the form a new server-side SDK (CLIENT) token will be generated for you.

You can always create API tokens for the new environment by following the [_Generating an API token_](../user_guide/token.mdx) guide.
