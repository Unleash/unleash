Environment cloning is a tool to enable an admin to clone an environment, including all feature toggles and strategies, into a new environment. See [_Cloning environments_](../user_guide/environments#cloning-environments) for more information.

## Step 1: Navigate to the environments page {#step-1}

Navigate to the _Environments_ page in the admin UI (available at the URL `/environments`). Use the navigation menu item "Configure" and select "Environments".

Select an environment to clone. On the right side, open the actions submenu and select "Clone".

## Step 3: Fill in the clone environment form {#step-3}

Give your new environment a name. The name must be unique and cannot be the same as the original environment. The name is pre-filled with a suggestion, but you can change it to whatever you like.

Select an environment type, and for which projects to clone the environment configuration in. You also have the option to keep the users permission for the new environment.

Finally, you have the option to either generate an API token later, or right away. If you choose to generate an API token right away, you will be able to select the token access and a new server-side SDK (CLIENT) token will be generated for you once you submit the environment details.

## Step 4 (optional): Save your token {#step-4}

If you selected to generate an API token right away, you will be presented with the token details. You can copy the token and save it somewhere safe, so it can be used to connect to your newly cloned environment right away.

If you opted to generate the token later, you can do it at any time by following the steps detailed in [_Generating an API token_](../user_guide/api-token).
