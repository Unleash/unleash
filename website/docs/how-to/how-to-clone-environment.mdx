Environment cloning is a tool to enable an admin to duplicate an existing environment, including all feature toggles strategies and their state. See [_Cloning environments_](../user_guide/environments#cloning-environments) for more information.

## Step 1: Navigate to the environments page {#step-1}

Navigate to the _Environments_ page in the admin UI (available at the URL `/environments`). Use the navigation menu item "Configure" and select "Environments".

Select an environment to clone. On the right side, open the actions submenu and select "Clone".

## Step 3: Fill in the clone environment form {#step-3}

Give your new environment a name. The name must be unique and cannot be the same as the original environment. The name is pre-filled with a suggestion, but you can change it to whatever you like.

Select an environment type, and which projects to clone the environment configuration in. You also have the option to keep the users permission for the new environment.

## Step 4 (optional): Generate a new API token {#step-4}

On the form, you also have the option to generate an API token right away. If you choose to do so, you will need to select the projects enabled for the new token. Once you submit the form a new server-side SDK (CLIENT) token will be generated for you.

## Step 5 (optional): Save your API token {#step-5}

If you selected the option to generate an API token right away in the previous step, once you clone the environment you will be presented with the token details. You can copy the token and use it to connect to your newly cloned environment right away.

If you opted to generate the token at a later stage, you can do it at any time by following the steps detailed in [_Generating an API token_](../user_guide/api-token).
