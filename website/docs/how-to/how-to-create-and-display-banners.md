This guide takes you through [how to create](#creating-banners "how to create banners") and [display](#displaying-banners "how to display banners") [banners](../reference/banners.md).

## Creating banners

### Step 1: Navigate to the banners page {#create-step-1}

Navigate to the _banners_ page in the admin UI (available at the URL `/admin/banners`). Use the _settings_ button in the navigation menu and select "banners".

### Step 3: Fill in the banner form {#create-step-3}

Choose whether the banner should be enabled right away. If enabled, the banner will be visible to all users in your Unleash instance. Select the banner type, icon, and write the message that you'd like to see displayed on the banner. The message and dialog fields support [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Optionally, you can also configure a banner action for user interactivity. For a full overview of all the banner options, consult the [banners reference documentation](../reference/banners).

You'll be able to preview the banner at the top as you fill in the form.

Once you're satisfied, use the "add banner" button to create the banner.

## Displaying banners

You can choose whether a banner is currently displayed to all users of your Unleash instance by toggling the "enabled" switch on the banner table. 

Alternatively, you can edit the banner by using the "edit" button on the banner table and then toggle the "banner status" switch.
