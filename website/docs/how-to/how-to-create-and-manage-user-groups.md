title: How to create and manage user groups
---

:::info availability

User groups are available to Unleash Enterprise users since **Unleash 4.14**.

:::

This guide takes you through how to use user groups to manage permissions on your projects. User groups allow you to manage large groups of users more easily than assigning roles directly to those users. Refer to the section on [user groups](../user_guide/rbac.md#user-groups) in the RBAC documentation for more information.

## Creating user groups

1. Navigate to groups by using the admin menu (the gear icon) and selecting the groups option.
