---

:::info availability

Personal access tokens are planned to be released in **Unleash 4.17**.

:::

Personal access tokens are a tool to enable a user to use the Admin API as themselves with their own set of permissions, rather than using an admin token. See [_how to use the Admin API_](../advanced/api_access) for more information.

## Step 1: Navigate to the personal access tokens page {#step-1}

Open the user profile pane in the admin UI and select the _view user profile_ menu item (available at the URL `/profile`).

## Step 3: Fill in the create personal API token form and create it {#step-3}

Give your token a description and optionally set an expiry date. By default the expiry date is set to 30 days.

## Step 4: Save your token {#step-4}

Once your new token is created, the popup will display the new token details. You must save your token somewhere outside of Unleash, you won't be able to access it again.

Your personal access token can now be used in place of an [admin token](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#admin-tokens).
