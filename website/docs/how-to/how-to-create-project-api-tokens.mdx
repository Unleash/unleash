:::info Permissions

Creating Project API tokens requires you to have the `CREATE_PROJECT_API_TOKEN` permission.

:::

Unleash SDKs use API tokens to authenticate to the Unleash API. Unleash supports different types of API tokens, each with different levels of access and privileges. Refer to the [API tokens and client keys](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx) article for complete overview of the different token types.

## Step 1: Navigate to the API token creation form {#step-1}

Navigate to the Project _API access_ page in the admin UI (available at the URL `/admin/projects/<project-name>/api-access`). Use the navigation tab "Project Settings" and select "API access".

On the API access page, use the "New API token" button to navigate to the token creation form.

Fill in the form with the desired values for the token you want to create. Refer to the [API tokens and client keys](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx#token-data) article for a detailed explanation of what all the fields mean.

## Using Project API tokens

When you have created the Project API token, it will be listed on the Project API access page. If you have the required permissions to see the token (`READ_PROJECT_API_TOKEN`), you can copy it for easy use in your applications.
