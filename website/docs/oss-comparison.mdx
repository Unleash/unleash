# Unleash OSS vs Unleash Enterprise

Unleash offers both an open-source (OSS) version and an Enterprise version.

[Unleash OSS](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash) gives you the foundation for safe, progressive delivery with feature flags.
[Unleash Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) extends that foundation with everything organizations need to scale their feature flag usage. This includes higher resource limits, advanced governance, automation, observability, and integrations for identity and compliance.

This page highlights the key differences between Unleash OSS and Unleash Enterprise.
