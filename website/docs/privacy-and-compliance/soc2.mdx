# SOC2 compliance

## Overview

To get SOC2 certified and maintain your compliance, you must ensure that any system you integrate with, including feature flagging solutions, adhere to the same compliance standards. Using a homegrown or third-party feature flagging system without SOC2 compliance can compromise your certification and introduce unnecessary risks.

This guide provides an overview of how [Unleash Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) features align with SOC2 Type II controls, helping your organization meet its compliance requirements.
