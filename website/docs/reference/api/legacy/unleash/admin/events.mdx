The Events API lets you retrieve [events](/reference/events) from your Unleash instance.

## Event endpoints

### Get all events

<ApiRequest verb="get" url="api/admin/events" title="Retrieve all events from the Unleash instance."/>

#### Query parameters

| Query parameter | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project` | When applied, the endpoint will only return events from the given project. | No |

When called without any query parameters, the endpoint will return the **last 100 events** from the Unleash instance. When called with a `project` query parameter, it will return only events related to that project, but it will return **all the events**, and not just the last 100.

#### Get events by project

<ApiRequest verb="get" url="api/admin/events?project=<project-name>" title="Retrieve all events belonging to the given project."/>

Use the `project` query parameter to make the API return _all_ events pertaining to the given project.

#### Responses

<details>
<summary>Responses</summary>

##### 200 OK

The last 100 events from the Unleash server when called without a `project` query parameter.

When called with a `project` query parameter: all events related to that project.
