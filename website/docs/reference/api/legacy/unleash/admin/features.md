:::caution Deprecation notice
Most of this API was deprecated as part of the v4.3 release and will be removed in v5.0. You should use [the project-based API (/api/admin/projects/:projectId)](/reference/api/legacy/unleash/admin/features-v2.md) instead. The deprecated endpoints are marked as such in the document below.
:::


:::info
In order to access the admin API endpoints you need to identify yourself. Unless you're using the `none` authentication method, you'll need to [create an **admin** token](/how-to/how-to-create-api-tokens) and add an Authorization header using the token.

## Fetching Feature Toggles {#fetching-feature-toggles}

:::caution Deprecation notice
This endpoint is deprecated. Please use the [project-based endpoint to fetch all toggles](/reference/api/legacy/unleash/admin/features-v2.md#fetching-toggles) instead.
:::

`GET: http://unleash.host.com/api/admin/features`

This endpoint is the one all admin ui should use to fetch all available feature toggles from the _unleash-server_. The response returns all active feature toggles and their current strategy configuration. A feature toggle will have _at least_ one configured strategy. A strategy will have a `name` and `parameters` map.

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "Feature.A",
      "description": "lorem ipsum",
      "type": "release",
      "enabled": false,
      "stale": false,
      "strategies": [
        {
          "name": "default",
          "parameters": {}
        }
      ],
      "variants": [
        {
          "name": "variant1",
          "weight": 50
        },
        {
          "name": "variant2",
          "weight": 50
        }
      ],
      "tags": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "type": "simple",
          "value": "TeamRed"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Feature.B",
      "description": "lorem ipsum",
      "enabled": true,
      "stale": false,
      "strategies": [
        {
          "name": "ActiveForUserWithId",
          "parameters": {
            "userIdList": "123,221,998"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "GradualRolloutRandom",
          "parameters": {
            "percentage": "10"
          }
        }
      ],
