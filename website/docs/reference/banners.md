:::info Availability

Banners were introduced as a beta feature in **Unleash 5.6** and are only available in Unleash Enterprise. We plan to make this feature generally available to all Enterprise users in **Unleash 5.7**.

:::

Banners allow you to configure and display internal messages that all users of your Unleash instance can see and interact with. They are displayed at the top of the Unleash UI, and can be configured to be interactive.

![Banners table](/img/banners-table.png)

A common use case could be to have some pre-configured banners that you can enable when you need to communicate something to your users. For example, you could have a banner that you enable when you're doing maintenance on your Unleash instance, and another banner that you enable when you're running a survey.

In order to create and display a banner, you can follow the [how to create and display banners](../how-to/how-to-create-and-display-banners.md) guide.

## Banner status

Banners can be enabled or disabled at any time. For more information on how to enable or disable a banner, see the section on [displaying banners](../how-to/how-to-create-and-display-banners.md#displaying-banners).

### Custom icon

To further personalize your banner, you can configure it with a custom icon.

To use a custom icon in your banner:
1. Select "Custom" in the icon dropdown.
2. Enter the name of the desired [Material Symbol](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
    - For example, for the "Rocket Launch" icon, enter `rocket_launch` in the custom icon field.

| Option          | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom icon** | The custom icon to be displayed on the banner, using [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons). |

## Banner action

You can set up an action for your banner:

| Option            | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Banner action** | The action activated when a user interacts with the banner link. Defaults to "None". Options include a [link](#link) or a [dialog](#dialog). |

### Link

When choosing the link action, a link will be displayed on the banner that directs users to a specified URL.

The configured URL can be absolute, as in e.g. `https://docs.getunleash.io/`, or relative as in e.g. `/admin/network`. Absolute URLs will open in a new tab.

| Option   | Description                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **URL**  | The URL to open when the user uses the banner link.       |
| **Text** | The text to display on the banner link.                   |

### Dialog

When opting for a dialog action, an interactable link appears on the banner which opens a dialog with additional information.

| Option             | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Text**           | The text to display on the banner link.                                                                 |
| **Dialog title**   | The title to display on the dialog.                                                                     |
| **Dialog content** | The content to display on the dialog. Supports [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). |

## Sticky banner

For added visibility, banners can be configured to be "sticky," ensuring they remain at the top of the Unleash UI, even after scrolling the page. This is useful for banners that you want to make sure that your users see and interact with.

| Option     | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sticky** | Whether the banner is sticky on the screen when scrolling. |
