The Command Menu provides a powerful interface for quick navigation and efficient workflow management within Unleash. It enables users to access recently visited pages, navigate through projects, and search for specific flags or features, all from a single command interface.

## Overview

The Command Menu consists of several key functionalities designed to enhance user productivity:

### Quick Suggestions

Upon opening the Command Menu, you will see a list of the last 5 pages you visited, whether they are features, projects, or other types of pages. This quick access feature allows you to resume your recent work without having to manually navigate back to those pages.

### Page Navigation

The Command Menu also includes a comprehensive list of all available pages, enabling quick navigation. This feature is particularly useful when you need to move swiftly between different sections of Unleash.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

To facilitate a mouseless workflow, the Command Menu can be accessed using the `Ctrl + K` keyboard shortcut. This ensures that you can bring up the Command Menu instantly, without interrupting your flow.

### Search Functionality

The Command Menu's search feature allows you to quickly find flags, projects, and pages based on your input. The search returns the following:

- **Feature Flags**: The first 3 feature flags that match your input will be shown. The search also includes descriptions, which are displayed when you hover over a feature flag in the dropdown list.
- **Projects**: The first 3 projects matching the search input will be listed.
- **Pages**: Any page that contains the input text will also appear in the results.

This search functionality is designed to be comprehensive, allowing you to find what you need based on various criteria, including text within descriptions.

### Feature Request Capability

If your search query does not return any results, the Command Menu will present a "Suggest Capability" button. This button allows you to request new features or capabilities that you might want to explore, ensuring that the system evolves with your needs.
