title: Feature Flags
---

## Overview

Feature flags are a core concept of Unleash. They allow you to release, test, and manage features and functionality across your application without changing the source code.

Feature flags exist within a [project](./projects) and have distinct configurations and [activation strategies](./activation-strategies) for each of the project's active [environments](./environments). Activation strategies determine whether a feature flag is enabled in a specific environment.

Feature flags have the following properties:

- **Name**: A [URL-friendly](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.3) string between 1 and 100 characters; must be unique per instance.
- **Type**: The [feature flag's type](#feature-flag-types); defaults to `Release`.
- **Project**: The [project](./projects) that contains the feature flag.
- **Description**: An optional description of the feature flag's purpose.
- **Impression data**: Indicates whether impression data is enabled for the flag; disabled by default.

## Environments and activation strategies

Feature flags have different [activation strategies](./activation-strategies) for each environment, allowing you to manage feature rollouts per environment.

To activate a feature within an environment, assign at least one activation strategy to it. If you don't specify a strategy, the default is a gradual rollout to 100%.

Activation strategies determine whether a feature flag activates for a specific [Unleash context](./unleash-context), such as a particular user or segment. When multiple strategies are in place, the flag activates if any one of the strategies evaluates to true.

### Strategy variants

You can enhance your feature flags with [strategy variants](./strategy-variants.md). Feature flags let you define who gets access to a feature. With variants, you can also determine which version of the feature they see.
For example, you might use variants to run an A/B testing experiment.

Variants are defined by a name and weight, which determines the likelihood of each variant being shown. [Stickiness](./stickiness) ensures that users consistently see the same variant based on predefined parameters.
Variants can also include payloads such as JSON, CSV, or strings to provide users with additional context.


## Feature flag types

**Version**: `3.5+`

Feature flags have a type to indicate their use case and help you manage and sort your flags. A feature flag's type determines its [expected lifetime](#feature-flag-lifetime), and its visual appearance in the Admin UI.


The following is a list of feature flag types:

| Feature flag type | Used to                                                                                                                                                       | Expected lifetime |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Release             | Manage the deployment of new or incomplete features.                                                                                          | 360 days           |
| Experiment          | Perform multivariate or A/B testing.                                                                                                                              | 40 days           |
| Operational         | Transition between technical implementations with minimal risk.                                                                                                            | 7 days            |
| Kill switch         | Gracefully degrade system functionality. | Permanent         |
| Permission          | Control feature access based on user roles or entitlements.                                                                                             | Permanent         |

## Feature flag state

A feature flag can have one of the following states: _active_, _potentially stale_, or _stale_. Unleash marks all flags as _potentially stale_ automatically once they pass their [expected lifetime](#feature-flag-lifetime).

State, together with expected lifetime, gives you an indication of when to [clean up a feature flag in code](./technical-debt.md).

You can also manually change the state on a feature flag's page by going to **Overview** and clicking **Toggle stale state**.

![Marking a feature flag as stale](/img/mark-flag-stale.png)

Marking a flag as stale helps you deprecate a feature flag without removing the active configuration for connected applications.

You can use this to signal to your team to stop using the feature in your applications. Stale flags will show as stale in the [technical debt dashboard](./technical-debt).

Marking a flag as stale generates the `feature-stale-on` [event](./reference/events#feature-stale-on). You can use [an integration](/integrations/integrations) to trigger automated workflows, such as posting notifications in a Slack channel, breaking project builds if the code contains stale flags, or automatically opening pull requests to remove stale flags from the code.

## Feature flag lifetime

Each feature flag type has an expected lifetime, which gives you an indication of when a feature flag might become stale. While some feature flag types are permanent, most flags are short-lived.

The lifetime and state indicators help you make decisions about what flags need to be [cleaned up](./technical-debt.md) in your codebase. See [11 Principles for building and scaling feature flags](../topics/feature-flags/feature-flag-best-practices) to learn more.

Once a feature flag exists for longer than its expected lifetime, Unleash changes its state to _potentially stale_.

With Admin access, you can configure the lifetime of a feature flag type. In the Admin UI, go to **Configure > Feature flag types** and edit the flag type you'd like to change.

## Feature flag lifecycle

:::note Availability

**Version**: `6.2+`

:::

Based on usage metrics and interactions with Unleash, feature flags can go through five distinct lifecycle stages: initial, pre-live, live, completed, and archived. These stages mirror the typical software development process and allow you to identify bottlenecks at any stage of the lifecycle. 
These insights can help you improve the efficiency of your software development process.


![Feature lifecycle](/img/feature-lifecycle.png)

### Lifecycle stages

#### Initial

The feature flag is created, but Unleash hasn't detected any metrics in any environments. Once Unleash receives metrics from a non-production environment, the flag moves to the [pre-live](#pre-live) stage.

A feature stuck in an initial stage can indicate integration issues in pre-production setups. 

#### Pre-live

The feature flag has received metrics in a non-production environment or a production environment that is disabled.

Too much time in the pre-live stage can suggest challenges in achieving production readiness. 

#### Live

The first users have been exposed to the feature in a production environment.

Once you have enough production usage data, you can mark the feature as completed. Marking the feature flag as complete does not affect any configuration; you decide whether to keep the feature, keep just one variant of it, or archive it entirely.

This stage serves as a reminder to start cleaning up the feature toggle and removing it from the code. A feature flag stuck in the live stage can indicate difficulties in data gathering or decision-making.

#### Completed

The feature has been completed but Unleash still receives usage metrics in production. This is an indication that you should clean up the feature flag from your code before archiving it.
If you've accidentally marked the feature as completed, you can revert it to the [live](#live) stage.

Too much time in the completed stage can indicate delays in decommissioning the feature and cleaning up resources.

#### Archived

Unleash hasn't detected any production usage metrics for at least two days. It's likely that it is safe to archive this flag.
If an archived feature is revived, it starts a new lifecycle with a new [initial](#initial) stage. 

## Naming patterns

:::note Availability

**Plan**: [Enterprise](https://www.getunleash.io/pricing) | **Version**: `5.7+`

:::

A consistent and unique feature flag naming pattern reduces risks and simplifies flag management by preventing the reuse of old names, which could accidentally re-enable outdated features.
Unique names also make it easier to track and search for flags across codebases, ensuring clarity on what each flag controls and its purpose.

To define a new naming convention for a project, go to **Project settings > Enterprise settings**. For **Naming Pattern**, define a valid [JavaScript regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).
Optionally, you can provide an example and a description to guide users when creating new flags.

Once saved, all future feature flag names in the project, including those created via the API, must follow the defined pattern. Note that the full feature flag name must match the pattern; partial matches are not sufficient.

For example, you could set a pattern like `^(red|blue|green)\.[a-z-]+\.[0-9]+$`. You could then provide an example of a valid feature flag name, such as "blue.fast-checkout.64" and a description like: "`<team>.<feature>.<ticket>`" to clarify the structure.

## Archive a feature flag

You can archive a feature flag once you no longer need it. To do so, go to the feature flag's page and click **Archive feature flag**.

Once archived, the flag is no longer available to client SDKs.

![Archive a feature flag](/img/archive-feature-flag.png)

### View archived flags

To view an archived feature flag, open the project that contains the flag and select the **Archived flags** tab.

### Revive a feature flag

You can revive archived flags by navigating to the [feature flag archive](#view-archived-flags) and clicking **Revive feature flag**. Revived flags are in an inactive state by default.

### Delete a feature flag

You can delete archived flags by navigating to the [feature flag archive](#view-archived-flags) and clicking **Delete feature flag**. 

However, we recommend not deleting feature flags unless they are completely removed from your codebase. If you delete a flag and later create a new one with the same name, it might unintentionally reactivate old code that still references the original flag.
