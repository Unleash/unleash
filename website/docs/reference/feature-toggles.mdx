title: Feature Flags

# Overview

Feature flags are a core concept of Unleash. Feature flags allow you to release, test, and manage features and functionality across your application without changing the source code.

Feature flags exist within a [project](../reference/projects) and have distinct configurations and [activation strategies](../reference/activation-strategies) for each of the project's active environments. Activation strategies determine if a feature flag is enabled in a specififc environment.

Feature flags have the following properties:

- **Name**: [URL-friendly](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.3) string between 1 and 100 characters; must be unique per instance.
- **Type**: The [feature flag's type](#feature-flag-types); `Release` by default.
- **Project**: The [project](../reference/projects) that contains the feature flag.
- **Description**: A description of the feature flag's purpose; optional.
- **Impression data**: Whether impression data is enabled for the flag; disabled by feault.

## Environments

You probably won't want to use the same configuration to enable a flag in development as you do in production. That's why feature flags have different activation strategy configurations for each environment.

You can enable and disable a flag independently in each of the [project's environments](../reference/projects). When you disable a flag in an environment, it will always evaluate to false in that environment. When you enable a flag in an environment, the flag will evaluate to true or false depending on its activation strategies.

Refer to the [documentation on environments](../reference/environments) for more details on how environments work.

## Activation strategies

To enable a feature in an environment, you must assign it at least one activation strategy. A feature flag's activation strategies determine whether the flag gets enabled for a particular [Unleash context](../reference/unleash-context) (typically a user). When using multiple strategies in a single environment, only a single strategy needs to evaluate to true for the flag to get enabled for a user. Whenever Unleash evaluates a flag, it will evaluate strategies in the current environment until one of them resolves to true. If no strategies resolve to true, then the flag's value is false.

Refer to the [activation strategies documentation](../reference/activation-strategies) for a detailed description of all the built-in strategies.

## Variants

[Variants](../reference/feature-toggle-variants) adds another dimension of flexibility to feature flags. Each feature flag can be assigned any number of variants which will then get distributed amongst your users based on your choice of [context field](../reference/unleash-context#structure). You can find out more about variants in the [variants docs](../reference/feature-toggle-variants).

### Creating flags with payloads

While variants are most often used for A/B testing and the like, you can also use variants to assign a constant payload to a flag. If you give a flag only a single variant and that variant has a payload, then all users variants will receive that payload.

You can use feature flags to support different use cases, each with their own specific needs.

A feature flag's type affects only two things:
1. It gives the flag an appropriate icon
2. The flag's expected lifetime changes

Aside from this, there are no differences between the flag types and you can always change the type of a flag after you have created it.

Classifying feature flags by their type makes it easier for you manage them: the flags get different icons in the flag list and you can sort the flags by their types.

A flag's type also helps Unleash understand the [flag's expected lifetime](#expected-lifetimes).

Here's the list of the feature flag types that Unleash supports together with their intended use case and expected lifetime:

| Feature flag type | Used to                                                                                                                                                       | Expected lifetime |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Release             | Enable trunk-based development for teams practicing Continuous Delivery.                                                                                          | 40 days           |
| Experiment          | Perform multivariate or A/B testing.                                                                                                                              | 40 days           |
| Operational         | Control operational aspects of the system's behavior.                                                                                                             | 7 days            |
| Kill switch         | Gracefully degrade system functionality. You can read about [kill switch best practices](https://www.getunleash.io/blog/kill-switches-best-practice) on our blog. | Permanent         |
| Permission          | Change the features or product experience that certain users receive.                                                                                             | Permanent         |

### Expected lifetimes

:::info

The ability to update a feature flag type's expected lifetime is currently in development. We expect to release it in one of the upcoming releases.

:::

A feature flag's expected lifetime is an indicator of how long Unleash expects flags of that type to be around. Some feature flags are meant to live for a few weeks as you work on new functionality, while others stick around for much longer. As a part of good code hygiene, you should clean up your feature flags when they have served their purpose. This is further explored in the document on [technical debt](/technical-debt).

Each feature flag type in Unleash has an assigned expected lifetime, after which the system will consider this feature _potentially stale_. The reasoning behind each type's expected lifetime is detailed in this [blog post on best practices for feature flag lifetimes](https://www.getunleash.io/blog/feature-toggle-life-time-best-practices).

Unleash admins can change the expected lifetime of Unleash's feature types from the Unleash configuration menu.


## Deprecating feature flags

You can mark feature flags as `stale`. This is a way to deprecate a feature flag without removing the active configuration for connected applications. Use this to signal that you should stop using the feature in your applications. Stale flags will show as stale in the ["technical debt dashboard"](./technical-debt).

When you mark a flag as stale, Unleash will emit an event. You can use [an integration](/integrations/integrations) to integrate this with your systems, for instance to post a message in a Slack channel.

Additionally, with some extra work, you can also use the `stale` property to:

- Inform developers that a flag is stale _while_ they're developing.
- Break a project build if the code contains stale feature flags.
- Send automatic PRs to remove usage of flags that have served their purpose.
