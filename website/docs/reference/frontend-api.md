title: Front-end API access
---

:::info Availability

The direct client-side API was released in _Unleash **v4.16**_.

<!-- TODO: link blog post with release notes -->

:::

**Direct client-side API access** offers a simplified workflow for connecting a client-side (front-end) applications to Unleash. It provides the exact same API as the [Unleash proxy](../sdks/unleash-proxy.md). Direct API access is a quick and easy way to add Unleash to single-page applications and mobile apps.

Compared to using the Unleash proxy, using direct API access has both benefits and drawbacks. The benefits are:

- **Managing client-side API tokens is easier.** With the Unleash proxy, you need to create and manage client keys manually; with the direct access API, you manage client-side API tokens in the exact same manner as other API tokens.
- **You don't need to configure and run an Unleash proxy.** The direct access API is part of Unleash itself and not an external process. All proxy clients will work exactly the same as they would with the Proxy.

On the other hand, direct API access has the following drawbacks compared to the proxy:

- **It can't handle a large number of requests per second.** Because the direct access API is part of Unleash, you can't scale it horizontally the way you can scale the proxy.
- **It sends client details to your Unleash instance.** Unleash only stores these details in its short-term runtime cache, but this can be a privacy issue for some use cases.

These points make the direct access API best suited for development purposes and applications that donâ€™t receive a lot of traffic, such as internal dashboards. However, because the API is identical to the Unleash proxy API, you can go from one to the other at any time. As such, you can start out by using the direct access API and switch to using the proxy when you need it.

## Using the direct access API

When using the direct access API in an SDK, there's three things you to configure.

### Front-end API tokens

As a client-side API, you should use a [front-end API token](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx#front-end-api-tokens) to interact with it. Refer to the [how to create API tokens](../user_guide/token.mdx) guide for steps on how to create API tokens.

### Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration {#cors)

You need to allow traffic from your application domains to use the direct access API with web and hybrid mobile applications. You can update the direct access API CORS settings from the Unleash UI under _admin \> CORS_ or by using the API (@tymek: what's the API for this?).

### API URL

The client needs to point to the correct API endpoint. The direct access API is available at `<your-unleash-instance>/api/frontend`.

<!-- Point to the API docs when they're published -->

### API token

You can create appropriate token, with type `FRONTEND` on `<YOUR_UNLEASH_URL>/admin/api/create-token` page or with a request to `/api/admin/api-tokens`. See our guide on [how to create API tokens](../user_guide/token.mdx) for more details.
