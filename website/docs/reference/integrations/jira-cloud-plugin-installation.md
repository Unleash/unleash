> The Jira Cloud Plugin is part of Unleash Enterprise.

With the Unleash Jira Cloud Plugin you can create new feature toggles in Unleash from a Jira issue as well as link
existing toggles to Jira issues.

The plugin also shows you current status of connected toggles.

## Prerequisites

### Jira Cloud

## Required access levels

### Unleash

You will need an Unleash admin to configure an admin API token. (Unleash Open Source)

For Unleash Enterprise we recommend [Service Tokens](https://docs.getunleash.io/how-to/how-to-create-service-accounts), this is also a requirement for integrating with Change Requests

## Configuring the plugin {#configure-plugin}

After the plugin has been installed, each project's project settings in Jira will have a menu entry link called "Unleash Project Settings" under the "Apps" menu section.

Following that link takes you to the "Unleash Project Settings" configuration page. This is where you specify the connection details (address and access token) for the Unleash server to be used with this particular project.

Once you have configured the connection for the Unleash server, your users should be ready to [use the Jira Cloud plugin](/integrations/jira_cloud_plugin_usage)
