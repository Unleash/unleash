title: Maintenance Mode
---

:::info Availability

The Maintenance mode was introduced in Unleash 4.21.0.

:::

Unleash maintenance mode is a feature that allows administrators to switch Unleash into a read-only "use-only" mode, with the exception that clients can still send metrics. While maintenance mode is enabled, users in unleash will be unable to change any configuration settings in the admin panel, and the APIs will not allow you to persist any changes. This feature is particularly useful during important events when any accidental or deliberate changes to the feature/strategy configuration could lead to issues.
## Maintenance mode configuration

You can easily toggle maintenance mode on and off in the Unleash admin view by navigating to the "Maintenance" section.

When maintenance mode is enabled, a warning banner appears at the top of the Unleash dashboard, indicating that any changes made during this period will not be saved and may result in errors.
