The **Network** dashboards in the Unleash Admin UI are designed to give you an overview of incoming requests to your Unleash instance. This includes requests from [Unleash SDKs](/reference/sdks), [Unleash Edge](/reference/unleash-edge), the [Unleash proxy](/reference/unleash-proxy) or the Unleash Admin UI.

To use these dashboards, you must configure an [external data source](#configure-a-data-source).

Requests from Unleash SDKs and other official Unleash applications include an application name. Requests that don't include an application name header (`UNLEASH_APPNAME`) are marked and aggregated as *unknown*.

You can access the **Network** dashboards in **Admin settings > Network** in the Unleash Admin UI.

## Overview

The **Overview** section displays the Unleash instance and applications that have connected to it within the last five minutes. Unknown applications are excluded from this view.

Each application in the diagram includes its name and the average number of requests per second over the last five minutes.

## Traffic

The **Traffic** section presents the requests that have consumed the most network traffic in the last six hours. These requests are grouped by client and base URL, with up to ten groups displayed.

Unleash aggregates requests by application name and base URL. Base URLs are batched using the first two path segments after `/api`. This means that Admin API requests are separate from Client API requests.

## Connected Edges

**Unleash version**: `6.8+` | **Unleash Edge version**: `19.7+`

:::

The **Connected Edges** dashboard provides detailed observability metrics for Unleash Edge, helping teams efficiently manage all their connected Edge instances. 
The dashboard offers a high-level view of all hosted Edge instances, with deeper insights into instance ID, region, CPU and memory usage, and upstream/downstream latency.

This data helps you ensure that all instances are operational and quickly identify potential issues.

## Data Usage

The **Data Usage** dashboard provides an overview of your requests to Unleash within a specific month, along with aggregated data over the last 3, 6, or 12 months. This allows you to track and assess your data usage over time.
You can also compare your usage in previous months with the current month.

## Configure a data source

To populate the Network dashboards, Unleash needs to read metrics from a Prometheus-compatible HTTP API (for example, Prometheus or VictoriaMetrics).

For this, you need to set up a two-way flow between Unleash and a Prometheus-compatible monitoring system:
	- Prometheus scrapes Unleash at /internal-backstage/prometheus.
	- Unleash queries Prometheus (via `PROMETHEUS_API`) to render the dashboards.

### Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Unleash

First, you must configure your Prometheus instance to pull metrics from Unleash's backstage API endpoint.

Add the following scrape job to your Prometheus configuration file (for example, `prometheus.yml`). Replace 'your-unleash-url' with the base URL of your Unleash instance.

```yaml
- job_name: unleash_internal_metrics
  metrics_path: /internal-backstage/prometheus
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['your-unleash-url']
```

This job tells Prometheus to periodically fetch metrics from the `/internal-backstage/prometheus` path on your Unleash server.


### Configure Unleash to query data from Prometheus
  
Set the `PROMETHEUS_API` environment variable in your Unleash instance to the base URL of your Prometheus-compatible query API. This URL must be network-accessible from your Unleash instance. It can be an internal service name (such as `http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local`) or a public URL.

```bash
PROMETHEUS_API=http://vmselect-unleash-vm.victoriametrics:8481/select/0:0/prometheus
```
