## Invite links
Any user using the _invite-link_ will be allowed to signup with Unleash using the UI and will be assigned the **_Viewer_** role.

The user will be taken directly to the signup page, where they can fill in their data and create an account.

Once the user is logged in as a **_Viewer_**, they will be able to navigate the Unleash UI but without being able to edit or create anything
