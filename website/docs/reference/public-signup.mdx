Public invite links allow you to invite new team members to your Unleash instance. Any user who receives an invite link can use it to sign up for the Unleash instance that generated the link. When users sign up using an invite link, they are automatically assigned the [Viewer](/reference/rbac.md#predefined-roles) role.

A token becomes active as soon as you create it, and remains valid until it expires or is deleted. Once a token is invalid, users can no longer sign up using an invite link containing that token.

You can have only one active invite token at any given time. If an active token already exists, you must delete it before you can [create a new one](#manage-the-public-invite-token).

## Manage the public invite token

As an Admin, you can create, update, and delete invite tokens through the Unleash Admin UI in **Admin settings > User config > Users > Create invite link**.

Alternatively, you can use the [Admin API](/get-started/api-overview) to manage the public invite token.
