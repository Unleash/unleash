<Figure caption="When you're close to reaching the limit for a resource, you'll see a warning in the Unleash UI. The warning will tell you what the limit is, how close you are to reaching it, and how you can increase the limit." img="/img/project-limit-warning.png" />

To ensure that Unleash operates smoothly, it includes resource limits for some of the key resources that you can create. The limit for each resource can vary between the different Unleash plans.

The resources and their respective limits and environment variables are:

| Resource                                                        | OSS limit | Pro limit | Enterprise limit | Environment variable                           |

## Overriding the limits

:::info Existing customers above the limits
Existing hosted customers who are already above the limits will have their limits adjusted to 110% of their maximum values when the limits were introduced.
:::

With a few exceptions, all the limits can be overridden through the use of their respective environment variables. However, while it is possible to override these limits, we advise against it in most cases. If you feel that you're unable to do what you need to do because of the limits, we'd love to hear from you.

The following resources have a lower limit of 1:
- feature flags
- strategies
- constraint values
- projects
- environments

If you try to set their limits lower than that, Unleash will automatically adjust them to 1.

If you operate a self-hosted Unleash instance, you can adjust the limit yourself. For hosted users of Unleash, you'll need to reach out and talk to your Unleash contact.

The only limits that can't be changed, are
- the limits for projects and environments for OSS instances
- the limits for projects and environments for Pro instances

[^1]: Archived feature flags do not count towards your feature flag total. The limit only applies to active (i.e. not archived) feature flags.
