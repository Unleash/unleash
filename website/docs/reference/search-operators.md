title: Search with filters/operators
---

:::info Availability

Search with filters/operators was introduced in **Unleash 5.9**.

:::

Search with filters/operators is a feature that allows users to conduct flexible data filtering. This feature is currently available on two specific pages: the Global Features Page and the Project Page.

## Search Bar

**Location**: The search bar is located at the top of the Global Features Page and the Project Page.

**Functionality**: It enables users to conduct searches for features using text. This is a **full-text search** that includes both feature names and feature descriptions.

**Multiple Keywords**: To search for multiple keywords, separate them with a comma. When searching with multiple keywords, there is effectively an **OR** condition between them, so the search will match items that contain either of the keywords. However, be aware that texts containing commas cannot be effectively searched, as the comma is used as a separator.

1. **Created Date**: Allows filtering based on the creation date of features.
2. **Project**: Allows filtering by specific projects.
3. **Segment**: Allows filtering based on segments.
4. **State**: Allows filtering by the state of features.
