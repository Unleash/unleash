Service accounts provide an identity for integration and automation tools to access the Unleash API. You can assign a role to a service account, granting it a specific set of permissions. Service accounts authenticate using tokens. They do not have a password and cannot access the Unleash Admin UI.

## Create a service account

To create service accounts in the Unleash Admin UI:
1. Go to **Admin > Service accounts.**
2. Enter a name and username for the service account and select a root role. 
3. Optionally, create and assign a service account token. You can also generate one later.
4. Click **Save service account**.

When a service account creates or modifies resources, Unleash uses the username of the account as the value for the _Created by_ or _Changed_ by properties of [events](./events).
