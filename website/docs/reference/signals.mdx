:::info Availability

Unleash signals is an **enterprise-only** feature released as beta in Unleash v5.11.

:::

## Overview

Signals enable external systems to communicate events to Unleash via a simple HTTP API.

Unleash can then configure automated actions to react to those events.

You can create different endpoints to be used by different systems, or you can create a single endpoint and use different API tokens for different systems.

## Creating signal endpoints

:::info Permissions

Creating signal endpoints require admin permissions.

:::

To create a new signal endpoint, navigate to the **Admin UI** and select **Integrations** from the configure menu.

![Integrations menu.](/img/signals/integrations.png)

In the integrations page, find the Signals integration:
![Integrations menu.](/img/signals/signals-option.png)

Clicking on the "New Signal" button will open a form where you can configure the signal endpoint.

## Using a signal endpoint

Using a signal endpoitn is as easy as sending a POST request to the signal endpoint URL with the correct API token. The body payload should be formatted as JSON.

```shell
curl -X POST https://unleash.example.com/api/signals/my-signal-endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "my-event",
    "data": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }'
```

Configuring an external system to use this API should be straightforward as there's no requirement on the payload structure.

## View signals as they arrive

To view the signals as they arrive, navigate to the **Signals** page in the **Admin UI** and select **View signals** option.

This will help you test that the integration is working before you send in the real signals.


## Limits that apply
There are some constraints on the signal endpoints as a meassure to protect our infrastructure. These values can be overriden for self-hosted installations.

- **Rate limit**: 10 requests per second.
- **Max endpoints**: 5.
- **Max tokens per endpoint**: 5.
- **Payload size**: 100kb (express default).
