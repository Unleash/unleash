title: Migration Execution
---

Now that we have completed the planning, below are some of our Best Practices for carrying out the migration based on our experience.

First, it can help to break the migration down into an order of activities, for example:

* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch**
    * Platform implemented, passed security/change management requirements, and available for developer use
    * Rollout to the highest priority groups of users
    * Matching use cases of the legacy platform
    * Legacy system fallback available
* **Medium-term**
    * Rollout to additional groups; adoption of further, less critical use cases
    * Sunset of legacy system
* **Longer term**
    * Adoption of new use cases

For each activity, plan for the Level of Effort (LoE), or the number of hours/days the task will take the assigned resource or group to fulfill.

Next up is risk handling. **Are there any perceived risks to the timelines that could be addressed upfront?**

* Have the teams involved with the migration committed to set hours for working the migration tasks upfront, have had migration project success criteria and their tasks communicated to them, and Q&A fulfilled?
* How long are various sign-offs by any relevant groups expected to take?
    * E.g. Change Advisory Board, Security Controls, hardening checks, etc
    * Plan to exceed each teamâ€™s documentation requirements to ensure fewer Requests for Information

Every step of the way, it can help to conduct reviews and look-backs at each rollout stage as well as what lies ahead.
