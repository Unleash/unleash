title: 10. Do no harm. Prioritize consistent user experience.
---

Feature flagging solutions are indispensable tools in modern software development, enabling teams to manage feature releases and experiment with new functionality. However, one aspect that is absolutely non-negotiable in any feature flag solution is the need to ensure a consistent user experience. This isn't a luxury; it's a fundamental requirement. Feature flagging solutions must prioritize consistency and guarantee the same user experience every time, especially with percentage-based gradual rollouts.

**Why Consistency is Paramount:**

1. **User Trust**: Consistency breeds trust. When users interact with an application, they form expectations about how it behaves. Any sudden deviations can erode trust and lead to a sense of unreliability.

2. **Reduced Friction**: Consistency reduces friction. Users shouldn't have to relearn how to use an app every time they open it. A consistent experience reduces the cognitive load on users, enabling them to engage effortlessly.

3. **Quality Assurance**: Maintaining a consistent experience makes quality assurance more manageable. It's easier to test and monitor when you have a reliable benchmark for the user experience.

4. **Support and Feedback**: Inconsistent experiences lead to confused users, increased support requests, and muddied user feedback. Consistency ensures that user issues are easier to identify and address.

5. **Brand Integrity**: A consistent experience reflects positively on your brand. It demonstrates professionalism and commitment to user satisfaction, enhancing your brand's reputation.

**Strategies for Consistency in Percentage-Based Gradual Rollouts:**

1. **User Hashing**: Assign users to consistent groups using a secure hashing algorithm based on unique identifiers like user IDs or emails. This ensures that the same user consistently falls into the same group.

2. **Segmentation Control**: Provide controls within the feature flagging tool to allow developers to segment users logically. For instance, segment by location, subscription type, or any relevant criteria to ensure similar user experiences.

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Include fallback mechanisms in your architecture. If a user encounters issues or inconsistencies, the system can automatically switch them to a stable version or feature state.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring. Continuously track which users are in which groups and what version of the feature they are experiencing. Monitor for anomalies or deviations and consider building automated processes to disable features that may be misbehaving.

5. **Transparent Communication**: Clearly communicate the gradual rollout to users. Use in-app notifications, tooltips, or changelogs to inform users about changes, ensuring they know what to expect.

In summary, consistency is a cornerstone of effective feature flagging solutions. When designing an architecture for percentage-based gradual rollouts, prioritize mechanisms that guarantee the same user gets the same experience every time. This isn't just about good software practice; it's about respecting your users and upholding their trust in your application. By implementing these strategies, you can create a feature flagging solution that empowers your development process and delights your users with a dependable and consistent experience.
