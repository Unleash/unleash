title: Unleash proxy hosting strategies
---

Because the [Unleash proxy](../sdks/unleash-proxy.md) is a separate piece of the Unleash architecture and because it should sit close to your application, there are numerous ways of hosting it. Another important distinction is whether you're hosting Unleash yourself or you have a managed solution.

Because of the hosting solutions we offer to our customers, there's three ways you can host the Unleash API and the proxy. Each is outlined below with some ...

Which way is right for you will depend on your setup and your needs.

## Unleash hosts everything

When Unleash hosts the proxy, it'll run alongside the Unleash API and the admin UI within Unleash's Kubernetes setup in AWS. The API is backed by an Amazon RDS database. Your applications can connect to the proxy from your own cloud or other hosting solution. You'll need to configure your proxy SDKs with the following details:
1. One of the [proxy's client keys](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx#proxy-client-keys). Unleash will provide you with the actual keys.
2. The proxy's endpoint. This will be the your Unleash instance's URL followed by "/api/proxy/development" or "/api/proxy/production" (depending on which environment you want to use).

This is the simplest, but also most limited (by far) way to host the proxy. In this setup, Unleash hosts both the Unleash API and the Unleash proxy. With Unleash hosting the proxy, you'll only need to worry about the client keys and the URL the proxy is hosted at.

While this is easy to get started with, it comes with some clear limitations:

1. This is only available to Pro and Enterprise customers who have signed up for a managed Unleash instance.
2. You'll get a total of two (2) proxies: One for the "development" environment and one for the "production" environment.
3. The proxies _will not_ scale, regardless of how many requests you're getting.
4. If you go above an average of 10 requests per second, then you'll be charged extra. (Is this pricing available anywhere?)
5. There's no guarantee that it'll be close to your applications. This means you'll get higher response times.
6. When we host the proxy, we will also receive whatever end user data you put in the [Unleash context](../user_guide/unleash-context.md). This may or may not be an issue depending on your business requirements.


## Self-hosted proxy, Unleash-hosted Unleash

You host the proxy yourself. It runs in a standalone container alongside your other applications in your cloud or hosting setup. Unleash manages the Unleash API, the admin UI, and the backing database in our AWS setup: the API and the UI run together in a Kubernetes deployment and connect to an Amazon RDS database.

You'll need to configure the proxy and the proxy client SDKs.

For the proxy, configure:
- The Unleash API url. This is your Unleash instance URL followed by "/api".
- A [client API token](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx#client-tokens). (Refer to [how to create API tokens](../user_guide/token.md) for the steps to create one.)
- One or more [proxy client keys](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys.mdx#proxy-client-keys). Refer to the [configuration section of the proxy document](../sdks/unleash-proxy#configuration) for more details.

For the proxy client SDK, configure:

1. One of the proxy client keys that you configured for the proxy.
2. The proxy's endpoint. This will depend on where and how you're hosting the proxy, but will typically end in "/proxy"


The middle-of-the-road solution

As you might expect, doing everything yourself _is_ going to give you the most flexibility, but it's also going to be the most work. If you're already hosting Unleash yourself, though, this shouldn't be any more difficult than the previous chapter.
