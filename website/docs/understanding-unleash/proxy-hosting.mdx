## Unleash architecture overview

Before exploring hosting options,  let's look at the key compontents of the Unleash architecture.:

![An architecture diagram of Edge and Unleash, using the recommended fully cloud-hosted offering](/img/edge-unleash-cloud-hosted.png)

- **Unleash API/server:** The central service that manages feature flags, strategies, configuration, and serves data to SDKs.
- **Unleash Admin UI:** The web interface used to manage flags, users, API tokens, view metrics, and configure your Unleash instance.
- **Unleash SDKs:** Libraries for integrating feature flags into your applications. [Server-side SDKs](/reference/sdks#server-side-sdks) and [client-side SDKs](/reference/sdks#client-side-sdks) fetch flag data from the Unleash API or Unleash Edge.
- **Unleash Edge:** A lightweight, scalable caching layer that sits between your SDKs and the Unleash API. Edge improves performance, resilience, and scalability, handling many SDK connections efficiently.

### Key APIs

Unleash exposes several APIs used by different components:

* **[Client API](/reference/api/unleash/client):** Used by server-side SDKs to fetch feature flag configurations and report metrics.
* **[Frontend API](/reference/api/unleash/frontend-api):** Used by client-side SDKs to fetch evaluated flags based on the provided [Unleash Context](/reference/unleash-context) and report metrics.
* **[Admin API](/reference/api/unleash):** Used by the Admin UI and other tools or [integrations](/reference/integrations) to manage all aspects of Unleash.

In the following sections, we explore key considerations for how you host Unleash and Unleash Edge.

## Cloud-hosted Unleash with cloud-hosted Edge

In this setup, Unleash manages the infrastructure for both the Unleash API server and Unleash Edge.

### Cloud-hosted Unleash 
This fully-managed solutiion, is designed for high availability, with the following key aspects:
- **Multi-AZ deployments:** Services are deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This means that your data and applications are distributed across different physical locations, reducing the risk of downtime due to localized failures.
- **Hot standby replica:** A continuously synchronized replica database stands ready in a separate AZ to take over if the primary database fails.
- **Automatic failover:** The system automatically detects AZ failures and fails over to the standby replica with minimal disruption.
- **Disaster recovery:** Full backups are stored in a separate region. A standby Unleash cluster in the backup region can take over in the rare event of a complete primary region failure.
- **CDN for static assets:** The Admin UI and static resources are served via a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast loading times worldwide.

### Cloud-hosted Unleash Edge

Unleash Enterprise Edge, our cloud-hosted Edge offering provides enterprise-grade security, full observability, and multi-region redudancy. Here are the key aspects of the offering:

- **Multi-AZ deployments:** Edge instances run across at least two AZs within each region.
- **Multi-region deployment:** Edge is available in multiple global regions (currently 11 across North America, Europe, and Asia). SDKs automatically connect to the nearest available region. Traffic fails over to other regions if one region becomes unavailable.
- **Resilience:** Edge caches flag configurations locally. SDKs connected to Edge can continue evaluating flags even if the connection to the primary Unleash API server is temporarily lost.
- **Scalability:** Edge acts as a read-only cache, handling numerous SDK connections while consolidating requests back to the main Unleash API server. It collects metrics from SDKs and syncs them periodically.


The Unleash Hosted Edge offering is optimized to provide high availability for applications reading configuration from Unleash, even across regions. Applications will be able to read configuration, even if the Unleash API is unavailable for a short period of time, as the Edge will keep a backup of the entire configuration. This ensures high-availability across regions. 

It's important to note that Unleash Edge will continue to serve clients with the latest up-to-date configuration, even if the connectivity to the upstream Unleash Service is lost. 

Her are key aspects of the Unleash Edge setup:
Multi-Availability Zone Deployments: Within each geographical region, we utilize at least two availability zones in order to ensure a high level of availability and redundancy.
Multi-Region Deployment: Unleash Edge is offered in multiple regions, with automatic routing to the closest region. If an entire region experiences an outage, traffic will be automatically rerouted to an available region.
SDK API: The Unleash Edge network functions as a read-only duplicate of feature flag configuration. This architecture enables the provision of a highly accessible experience for all applications connected to Unleash. Furthermore, the Edge instance collects usage metrics from the SDKs and synchronizes this data back to the Unleash API at regular intervals.

Enterprise Edge is available in 11 global data centers across North America, Europe, and Asia, so you can achieve low latency, high resilience, and optimal performance in any region.

US East (Ohio)	           us-east-2
US East (N. Virginia)	   us-east-1
US West (Oregon)	       us-west-2
Asia Pacific (Mumbai)	   ap-south-1
Asia Pacific (Singapore)   ap-southeast-1
Asia Pacific (Sydney)	   ap-southeast-2
Asia Pacific (Tokyo)	   ap-northeast-1
Europe (Frankfurt)	       eu-central-1
Europe (Ireland)	       eu-west-1
Europe (London)	           eu-west-2
Europe (Paris)	           eu-west-3

Using Unleash Edge is optional, you can also access the Unleash API directly using the [Frontend or Client API](#key-apis). 

This setup comes with the following considerations:
- **Fair Use Policy:** Sending requests to the Unleash API is subject to limits outlined in the [Fair Use Policy](https://www.getunleash.io/fair-use-policy). While short traffic spikes are accommodated, sustained high traffic might require using Unleash Edge.
- **Latency:** Although, the Unleash architecture is designed for incredibly fast flag evaluations thanks to cashing in the SDKs, the central Unleash API server might not be geographically close to all your end-users, potentially increasing flag evaluation latency.
- **Data privacy:** When using the Frontend API to talk to Unleash, any end-user data included in the [Unleash Context](../reference/unleash-context.md) is sent directly to the Unleash server. Evaluate if this meets your privacy requirements. Using Edge avoids sending this context data directly to the central Unleash API server.

## Cloud-hosted Unleash with self-hosted Unleash Edge

In this hybrid model, Unleash hosts the API server and Admin UI, while you host Unleash Edge instances yourself.

![An architecture diagram of using Edge in a setup where Unleash hosts the API and you host the Edge.](/img/self-hosted-edge-cloud-hosted-unleash.png)

You host Edge yourself. It runs in a standalone container alongside your other applications in your cloud or hosting setup. Unleash manages the Unleash API, the Admin UI, and the backing database in our AWS setup; the API and the UI run together in a Kubernetes deployment and connect to an Amazon RDS database.

You'll need to configure Edge and the SDKs.

### Configure Unleash

- Create one or more [client API tokens](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#client-tokens) scoped to the projects/environments you wish to use the Edge instance for.
- Create frontend tokens for the frontend apps that will retrieve feature flags from Edge.

### Configure Edge

Edge will fetch feature flags from the specified upstream Unleash instance for every client API key it has been made aware of, either during startup (recommended) or separate endpoint requests. It will then periodically sync features with upstream.

It will then accept frontend or backend tokens from application SDKs.

Make sure to use the correct token type for your use case:

- Frontend API: Use for frontend-facing apps; Edge returns application-specific context.
- Client API: Use for backend SDKs; Edge returns the entire flag payload for the scope of the token (project/environment).


#### Start Edge and populate flag cache

This initial command will populate the flag cache on startup using the client token specified in the environment variable:

```docker run -p 3063:3063 -e TOKENS='CLIENT_API_TOKEN' -e UPSTREAM_URL='UPSTREAM_URL' unleashorg/unleash-edge:v8.1 edge```

The following can be used to pass new tokens to Edge for different project/environment scopes:

```curl --location --request GET 'http://0.0.0.0:3063/api/client/features' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 'Authorization: NEW_TOKEN' \ --data-raw ''```

### On SDKs

- Point frontend/client SDKs to Edge endpoints:
    - **Backend SDKs**: `/api/client`.
    - **Frontend SDKs**: `/api/frontend`, `/api/proxy`.


## Self-hosted Unleash and Unleash Edge

![An architecture diagram of using the Edge in a single-region, self-hosted setup.](/img/proxy-hosting-customer-single-edge.svg)

You host everything yourself. Everything runs where and how you configure it to.

**To configure Edge and the SDKs, follow steps in the [previous section on Unleash hosts the API, you host Edge](#unleash-hosts-the-api-you-host-edge)**

As you might expect, doing everything yourself gives you the most flexibility, but also requires the most effort. However, if you're already hosting Unleash yourself, this shouldn't be any more difficult than the previous section.

As described in the [section on tradeoffs between self-hosted and Unleash-hosted setups](#unleash-hosted-or-self-hosted), running Edge yourself gives you a number of benefits.


## Multi-region

![An architecture diagram of using the proxy in a multi-region, self-hosted setup.](/img/proxy-hosting-customer-multi-edge.svg)

You can also use Edge for a multi-region setup. You can run Edge in a different region to the API and still connect to the API. Because Edge runs closer to your applications it still provides you benefits in terms of quicker response times. Everything should be configured as described in the [you host everything section](#you-host-everything) or the [Unleash hosts the API, you host Edge section](#unleash-hosts-the-api-you-host-edge). You can add as many Edge instances in as many extra regions as you want.


## Self-hosting Unleash Proxy

:::note

Unleash Proxy has been deprecated, use [Unleash Edge](../reference/unleash-edge) instead.
If you are an existing Proxy user, see our [Edge migration guide](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash-edge/blob/main/migration-guide.md) for a guide on how to migrate.
:::


You host the proxy yourself. It runs in a standalone container alongside your other applications in your cloud or hosting setup. Unleash manages the Unleash API, the admin UI, and the backing database in our AWS setup: the API and the UI run together in a Kubernetes deployment and connect to an Amazon RDS database.

You'll need to configure the proxy and the proxy client SDKs.

For the proxy, configure:

-   The Unleash API url. This is your Unleash instance URL followed by `/api`.
-   A [client API token](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#client-tokens).
-   One or more [proxy client keys](../reference/api-tokens-and-client-keys#proxy-client-keys). Refer to the [configuration section of the proxy document](../reference/unleash-proxy#configuration-options) for more details.

For the proxy client SDK, configure:

-   One of the proxy client keys that you configured for the proxy.
-   The proxy's endpoint. This will depend on where and how you're hosting the proxy, but will typically end in `/proxy`.

This setup requires a little more setup on your part than the Unleash-hosted proxy does, but it offers all the benefits described in the [section on tradeoffs between self-hosted and Unleash-hosted setups](#unleash-hosted-or-self-hosted).
