title: Unleash hosting options
---

Unleash provides flexible hosting options for Unleash and [Unleash Edge](../generated/unleash-edge.md), allowing you to meet specific requirements for scaling, privacy, and infrastructure control. This document covers the main hosting models for the Unleash API server and Unleash Edge. Choosing a hosting model is a key architectural decision.

## Unleash architecture overview

Before exploring hosting options, let's look at the key components of the Unleash architecture:

![Unleash architecture overview](/img/unleash-architecture-edge.png)

- **Unleash API/server:** The central service that manages feature flags, strategies, configuration, and serves data to SDKs.
- **Unleash Admin UI:** The web interface used to manage flags, users, API tokens, view metrics, and configure your Unleash instance.
- **Unleash SDKs:** Libraries for integrating feature flags into your applications. [Server-side SDKs](/reference/sdks#server-side-sdks) and [client-side SDKs](/reference/sdks#client-side-sdks) fetch flag data from the Unleash API or Unleash Edge.
- **Unleash Edge:** A lightweight, scalable caching layer that sits between your SDKs and the Unleash API. Edge improves performance, resilience, and scalability, handling many SDK connections efficiently.

To facilitate communication between these components, Unleash exposes three APIs:

- **[Client API](/reference/api/unleash/client):** Used by server-side SDKs to fetch feature flag configurations and report metrics.
- **[Frontend API](/reference/api/unleash/frontend-api):** Used by client-side SDKs to fetch evaluated flags based on the provided [Unleash Context](/reference/unleash-context) and report metrics.
- **[Admin API](/reference/api/unleash):** Used by the Admin UI and other tools or [integrations](/reference/integrations) to manage all aspects of Unleash.

In the following sections, we explore key considerations for how you host Unleash and Unleash Edge.

## Cloud-hosted

In this setup, Unleash manages the infrastructure for both the Unleash API server and Unleash Edge.

### Cloud-hosted Unleash 
This fully-managed solution is designed for high availability, featuring the following key aspects:
- **Multi-AZ deployments:** Services are deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This means that your data and applications are distributed across different physical locations, reducing the risk of downtime due to localized failures.
- **Hot standby replica:** A continuously synchronized replica database stands ready in a separate AZ to take over if the primary database fails.
- **Automatic failover:** The system automatically detects AZ failures and fails over to the standby replica with minimal disruption.
- **Disaster recovery:** Full backups are stored in a separate region. A standby Unleash cluster in the backup region can take over in the rare event of a complete primary region failure.
- **CDN for static assets:** The Admin UI and static resources are served via a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast loading times worldwide.

### Cloud-hosted Unleash Edge

[Unleash Enterprise Edge](https://www.getunleash.io/unleash-enterprise-edge), our cloud-hosted Edge offering, provides enterprise-grade security, full observability, and multi-region redundancy. Here are the key aspects of the offering:

- **Multi-AZ deployments:** Edge instances run across at least two AZs within each region.
- **Multi-region deployment:** Edge is available in multiple global regions. SDKs automatically connect to the nearest available region. Traffic fails over to other regions if one region becomes unavailable.
- **Resilience:** Edge caches flag configurations locally. SDKs connected to Edge can continue evaluating flags even if the connection to the primary Unleash API server is temporarily lost.
- **Scalability:** Edge acts as a read-only cache, handling numerous SDK connections while consolidating requests back to the main Unleash API server. It collects metrics from SDKs and syncs them periodically.

[Enterprise Edge](https://www.getunleash.io/unleash-enterprise-edge) is available in the following 11 global data centers across North America, Europe, and Asia, allowing you to achieve low latency, high resilience, and optimal performance:
- US East (Ohio): `us-east-2`
- US East (N. Virginia): `us-east-1`
- US West (Oregon): `us-west-2`
- Asia Pacific (Mumbai): `ap-south-1`
- Asia Pacific (Singapore): `ap-southeast-1`
- Asia Pacific (Sydney): `ap-southeast-2`
- Asia Pacific (Tokyo): `ap-northeast-1`
- Europe (Frankfurt): `eu-central-1`
- Europe (Ireland): `eu-west-1`
- Europe (London): `eu-west-2`
- Europe (Paris): `eu-west-3`

### Using Unleash without Edge
Using Unleash Edge is optional. You can also access the Unleash API directly using the [Frontend or Client API](#key-apis). This setup comes with the following considerations:
- **Fair Use Policy:** Sending requests to the Unleash API is subject to limits outlined in the [Fair Use Policy](https://www.getunleash.io/fair-use-policy). While short traffic spikes are accommodated, sustained high traffic might require using Unleash Edge.
- **Latency:** Although the Unleash architecture is designed for incredibly fast flag evaluations thanks to caching in the SDKs, the central Unleash API server might not be geographically close to all your end users, potentially increasing flag evaluation latency.
- **Data privacy:** When using the Frontend API to talk to Unleash, any end-user data included in the [Unleash Context](../reference/unleash-context.md) is sent directly to the Unleash server. Evaluate if this meets your privacy requirements. Using Edge avoids sending this context data directly to the central Unleash API server.

## Hybrid

In this hybrid model, Unleash hosts the API server and Admin UI, while you host Unleash Edge instances yourself. You run Edge as a container within your own infrastructure, close to your applications. This gives you control over Edge's location and its network environment. Unleash manages the Unleash API, the Admin UI, and the backing database in our AWS setup; the API and the UI run together in a Kubernetes deployment and connect to an Amazon RDS database.

In this setup, you need to configure Edge and the SDKs.

### Configure Edge

Set the `UPSTREAM_URL` environment variable to your Unleash instance URL (e.g., `https://<your-instance>.app.unleash-hosted.com/api`):
    - Provide the Client API tokens using the `TOKENS` environment variable. This allows Edge to fetch the correct flag configurations on startup.
    - Run the Edge container. Example using Docker:
        ```bash
        docker run -p 3063:3063 \
        -e UPSTREAM_URL='<UPSTREAM_URL>' \
        -e TOKENS='<CLIENT_API_TOKEN>' \
        unleashorg/unleash-edge:latest edge
        ```
    - To add configurations for other projects/environments dynamically after startup, you can send an authorized request to Edge using a different Client API token:
        ```bash
        curl --location --request GET 'http://<your-edge-host>:3063/api/client/features' \
        --header 'Authorization: <NEW_CLIENT_API_TOKEN>'
        ```

### Configure the SDKs

Point your SDKs to your self-hosted Edge instance's URL.
    - **Server-side SDKs:** Use the `/api/client` endpoint and a Client token. Edge returns the full flag configuration for the token's scope.
    - **Client-side SDKs:** Use the `/api/frontend` endpoint and a Frontend token. Edge evaluates flags based on the context provided by the SDK and returns only the evaluated feature flags.


## Self-hosted

In this model, you host and manage all components: the Unleash API server, the database, the Admin UI, and Unleash Edge instances.

![An architecture diagram of using the Edge in a single-region, self-hosted setup.](/img/self-hosted-single-region.png)

This option offers maximum flexibility and control over your feature management infrastructure but requires the most operational effort.

In addition to [configuring Edge](#configure-edge), you must also set up the Unleash server and its database following our [self-hosting guide](../using-unleash/deploy/getting-started).


### Multi-region self-hosted Edge

You can deploy self-hosted Edge instances in multiple geographic regions, even if your primary Unleash API server is in a single location.

![An architecture diagram of using the proxy in a multi-region, self-hosted setup.](/img/self-hosted-multi-region.png)

Each Edge instance connects back to your central Unleash API server but serves SDKs in its local region. This reduces latency for your applications by keeping flag evaluation geographically close.


## Self-hosted Unleash Proxy

:::note

Unleash Proxy has been deprecated, use [Unleash Edge](../reference/unleash-edge) instead.
