title: Migrate from Unleash Proxy
---

Unleash Edge is the successor of the now-deprecated Unleash Proxy. It functions as a lightweight read replica of your Unleash instance, designed to scale your feature flag infrastructure significantly.

While Edge maintains the same security and privacy guarantees as the Proxy, it offers fundamental improvements in performance and architecture. This guide details the differences between the two services and provides steps to migrate your existing setup.

## Key differences

| Feature | Unleash Proxy | Unleash Edge |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Performance** | Handles hundreds of requests per second (RPS). | Handles tens of thousands of RPS with lower memory usage. |
| **Environments** | Supports a single [environment](/concepts/environments) per instance. Requires separate instances for Development and Production. | Supports multiple [environments](/concepts/environments) in a single instance. Dynamically routes requests based on the API token. |
| **Upstream URL** | Requires the /api suffix (https://unleash-instance.com/api). | No `/api` suffix (https://unleash-instance.com). |
| **[Backend SDKs](/sdks#backend-sdks)** | Requires experimental flags and specific configuration. | Supported out of the box. |
| **Language** | Node.js | Rust (Single binary, no runtime dependencies). |

## Migration path: Hosted Edge

If you are migrating to Enterprise Edge hosted, you do not need to deploy any infrastructure.

1. **Request Enterprise Edge**: Contact your customer success representative to request Enterprise Edge.
2. **Get your Edge URL**: Note the specific regional URL provided in the Admin UI (for example, `https://<region>.unleash-edge.com`).
3. **Update SDKs**: Update your frontend and backend SDKs to point to this new Edge URL instead of your old Proxy URL.

## Migration path: Self-hosted Edge

For self-hosted setups, you must replace your Proxy container with the Edge container and update your configuration.

### 1. Update the upstream URL

The most common configuration error during migration is the URL format used to connect Edge to Unleash.

```diff
- UNLEASH_URL=https://your-instance.com/api
+ UPSTREAM_URL=https://your-instance.com
```

### 2. Consolidate instances

If you previously ran separate Proxy instances for development and production, you can now replace them with a single Edge instance.
Edge determines the correct [environment](/concepts/environments)
 from the API token provided by the SDK and serves responses from its local cache accordingly.

Deploy a single Edge container. Provide a startup token that has access to both environments (or use a wildcard token).
Edge will automatically route incoming SDK requests to the correct environment based on the token the SDK provides.

### 3. Configure tokens

Edge handles tokens differently than the Proxy. Unlike the Proxy, where you could define arbitrary secrets, Edge requires valid Unleash tokens to fetch data. All tokens used by clients must be valid tokens generated in the Unleash Admin UI.

To serve any traffic (even for frontend clients), Edge must have the feature data in its cache. You must start Edge with at least one [backend token](/concepts/api-tokens-and-client-keys#backend-tokens) that covers the [projects](/concepts/projects) and [environments](/concepts/environments) you intend to serve.

### 4. Deploy and update networking

Deploy the Edge container (listening on port `3063` by default) in place of your Proxy container. Update your load balancer or ingress rules to direct traffic to the new service.

### 5. Verify SDK connections

Ensure your [frontend](/sdks#frontend-sdks) and [backend SDKs](/sdks#backend-sdks) are pointing to the Edge URL. No code changes are required in the SDKs themselves; they use the standard client and frontend [APIs](/api).

## Advanced concepts

Once migrated, you can leverage features that were difficult or not feasible with the Proxy.

### Daisy chaining

You can chain Edge instances to create complex topologies. For example, a central Edge node can sync with Unleash, while regional Edge nodes sync with the central node.

- **Configuration**: Point the downstream Edge's `UPSTREAM_URL` to the upstream Edge instance.
- **Metrics**: Metrics propagate up the chain from the `SDK -> Regional Edge -> Central Edge -> Unleash`.

For more information, see [Daisy chaining](/unleash-edge/deploy#daisy-chaining).

### Offline mode

Edge supports a dedicated [Offline mode](/unleash-edge/configure#offline-mode) for local development or air-gapped environments. This replaces the need to run a local Proxy with a mock config. See [Offline mode configuration](/unleash-edge/configure#offline-mode-configuration) for details.

## Unsupported features in Edge

Edge is designed for scale and efficiency, which necessitates dropping support for some legacy features:

- **Custom strategies:** Edge does not support [custom activation strategies](/concepts/custom-activation-strategies). You must migrate these to standard [strategy constraints](/concepts/activation-strategies#constraints).
- **Context enrichers:** The Proxy's experimental context enrichers are not supported in Edge.
- **Custom JS integration:** Since Edge is written in Rust, you cannot wrap it in custom JavaScript code like the Node.js Proxy.
